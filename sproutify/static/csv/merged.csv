","Jakarta, Indonesia",Indonesia,Nonprofit,,"<p>• <strong>Pregnancy complications. In Indonesia</strong>, there are around 120 babies, and 12 pregnant mothers die every day. Mothers here are 36x more likely to suffer pregnancy complications compared to them in developed countries. Based on our data, there are 6 out of 100 pregnancies facing pre-eclampsia and 10 out of 100 pregnancies facing preterm birth. These pregnancy complications can be life-threatening if left untreated. However, the problem is that not all mothers have equal access to healthcare facilities due to the high cost of healthcare. Early prediction with early prevention is the only way to minimize this condition.<br />• <strong>Non-tech-based method.

</p>
<p>·       <strong>Teleconsulting (Monitoring and Warning system)</strong>: Provide a platform to connect mothers and an OB/GYN to share and discuss pregnancy conditions with recommended treatment based on medical data stored in our electronic health record. Mothers will be monitored for their blood pressure, aspirin consumption, uterine contractions, number of fetal movements, blood sugar curves, diabetes medication, USG timeline, estimated fetal weight curve, and check-up schedule.

Anti-violence and mental health educational applications need to continue to be displayed on smartphones.

The current situation of children at primary education level is that more than 50% have used smartphones by their parents to obtain information. Both in the realm of games and in video as well as information and other applications on the smartphone. The use of smartphones for children exploded during the Covid-19 pandemic, and there was even a demand for (must have) the use of this technology so that it could be used for online learning. It is certain that the use of smartphones can distort their use and even accidentally appear applications that have a negative influence on these children. Currently, it can be said that there is a potential emergency for violence and poor mental health for the world's next generation of children. It is important for children in the secondary education period (aged 10-19 years) to be provided with education about anti-violence and mental health. At this age, the development of character formation, including physical, emotional and cognitive changes, is very significant. They even tend to seek self-identity and seek superior recognition from their peer group. The provision of educational materials at school is predominantly conventional learning materials such as; scientific educational materials, number calculations, natural knowledge, biology and other scientific materials. It touches very little and does not even provide material about anti-violence and mental health. Most of this education is only used as educational appeals or campaigns during certain events or times. Therefore, it is very important to provide anti-violence and mental health educational material to teenagers simultaneously, especially via smartphone so that they are not burdened with the formal education they receive from school. In fact, these teenagers will get information and even need guidance and direction other than their parents. Health education via smartphone does not only provide informational material, but the application enables the application to become a forum for consultation as well as a place for guidance and seeking protection if a teenager experiences problems with bullying, violence or even poor mental health. One thing that must be understood in this program is that creating professional human resources is not only about being smart in terms of science, but mental and mental health is very bad. It is hoped that this program will be able to have an impact on the beneficiaries, not only school teenagers but also impact teachers, children who cannot afford to go to school and children who are experiencing problems with the law so that they can be coached and reported.</em></p>","<p><em>So far, the HTF program has been dominant in providing educational support, mentoring and training activities to groups at risk of contracting HIV and communities living with HIV. This is strengthened because of financial support from donors which puts more pressure on the beneficiaries directly. Limited funding for program development has not been implemented optimally. If you look closely, the HTF program focuses more on curative treatment for people affected by this problem (especially those infected with HIV), but is very lacking in implementing prevention programs. What must be done if you want to reduce infection and the spread of disease is to stop breaking the chain from the beginning of the source of the problem. This is what the current HTF program needs to prioritize, namely an emphasis on early prevention programs. The YHT program has not directly touched on education about violence (emotional, physical, sexual, etc.) or mental health. However, there are several administrators with professional YHT Human Resources backgrounds who are sometimes invited to be resource persons in providing education related to reproductive health and public health among teenagers/students at universities and in community groups. HTF has limited resources to carry out activity programs for community groups, especially marginalized groups and survivors. Therefore, HTF actively seeks funding support from both national and international donors. Programs that have been implemented over the last 4 years are (1) Caring Response to Overcome Stigma and Discrimination among HIV-AIDS Sufferers through the Central Kalimantan Province Interfaith Forum (2019-2020) which is supported by the Niwano Peace Foundation; (2) HTF took place with several local NGOs to raise funds, food ingredients and Personal Protective Equipment to help Health workers, PLHIV and other marginalized communities affected by Covid-19 socially and economically (2020); (3) Towards Empowered, Productive and Independent PLWHA in Kalimantan (2021-2022) supported by Gilead Inc. Thanks to the support of several international donors, especially Gilead Inc. HTF can be a reference information for individuals, government/private institutions, marginalized communities, especially Peer Support Groups. HTF is also aware of the lack of Human Resources who understand the latest technology. Therefore, the implementation of this program is certainly not only limited to Personal HTF, but will involve professional staff in the field, especially those who understand computer-based program application technology with smartphones. HTF personnel are practitioners, researchers and activists, especially in the health sector. Here there is no need to doubt his ability to analyze phenomena and as a data-based conceptor of community health programs. However, it still has limitations, especially in terms of technology which is developing so rapidly.

HTF realizes that this institution is still small in scale, only accepting a small number of donors. because if you want to get medium and large donors, you definitely have very complete requirements. Currently HTF still has shortcomings in terms of management, especially regarding independent audits, because carrying out independent audits requires quite large costs. Meanwhile, currently we are very limited in carrying out operations in our own office, considering that the staff working at HTF is still project-based only. However, this does not dampen HFT's intention to provide information and support to marginalized groups and communities that we build as grassroots partners.</em>
  <em>HTF really hopes for support from donors who are willing to achieve maximum goals. Therefore, HTF continues to look for international donors who are of course aligned and have the same vision to achieve humanitarian goals. HTF has long had information about SOLVE, and even linked information via HTF emails. There are many opportunities announced by SOLVE, however due to limited HFT personnel it is an obstacle to exploring and preparing complete applications provided by SOLVE. HTF really hopes that through trust and support, SOLVE will be able to bring this organization to receive support from various partners and provide the desired support so that in the future HTF is able to be independent without seeking donor support for each of its programs. HTF still has the burden of running the program, namely the goal of having a special clinic for risk groups, especially HIV and TB and other sexually transmitted diseases. Apart from that, we hope to have a halfway house for individuals and victims of violence, which is currently not available. Because HTF finds many cases, for example there are people who were expelled from their workplace or family without temporary shelter.</em><br /></p>","Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)","Dedy, chairperson HTF",No,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Email from Solve,"<p><em>HTF is a small scale institution, therefore to implement each program it continues to seek support from international donor agencies.

This is reinforced by the shift in HIV transmission patterns in Indonesia. HIV transmission began in 1990 and was more contagious to gay people, and as time passed in 2000 and transmission increased among female sex workers, including transgender people. Currently (in 2024) transmission is actually increasing again in gay, lesbian and transgender groups. This is where changes in the behavioral orientation of women and men occur. Sexual orientation is everyone's personal right, but healthy sexual behavior is an important thing that needs to be implemented. The solution to emphasize Health Education starting from the younger generation is very important, this must be balanced with current developments, especially the rapid development of technology. As stated at the beginning, it is very useless for us to provide formal education to create quality human resources but not for very poor mental health, soul and personality. This will create more young generations of psychopaths who have problems with violence, stigma and discrimination as well as poor mental health.</em>
  <em>Technology will of course continue to develop, the use of smartphones has now become a habit for everyone in carrying out their activities. It's time for every person and organization to care about saving the younger generation by keeping up with technological developments, starting with the use of smartphones, which need to be equipped with education that educates the current generation of teenagers. It is hoped that smartphone companies and application providers will not only generate financial profits, but are also expected to be able to provide education about health which is currently moving in a far deviant direction. Providing smartphones with applications for health education on anti-violence and mental health will continue to stick in their brains and have an impact on changing behavior towards anti-violence and good mental health.

Anti-violence and mental health educational applications need to continue to be displayed on smartphones. This application is not only used to provide education, but also as a place for consultation and communication in emergencies when violence occurs. It is human nature that information that is continuously provided will be embedded in the brain. This is the same as providing conventional educational learning at schools and universities. Through educational applications on smartphones that they always carry, it will have an impact on changing behavior towards non-violence and good mental health. Providing health education applications via smartphone can reduce quite a large amount of costs compared to providing education in the form of mass meetings or through printed books or leaflets/brochures. The use of health education applications can be utilized by school teenagers throughout the world. This application will of course always be updated regularly based on developments and based on culture in each region/region. It is time for the use of health education applications via smartphones to save a generation of teenagers who are anti-violent without stigma and discrimination and have good mental health.
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : According to the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency, there are as many as 15 million teenagers who are studying at the secondary level. The current situation of children at primary education level is that more than 50% have used smartphones by their parents to obtain information. Both in the realm of games and in video as well as information and other applications on the smartphone. The use of smartphones for children exploded during the Covid-19 pandemic, and there was even a demand for (must have) the use of this technology so that it could be used for online learning. It is certain that the use of smartphones can distort their use and even accidentally appear applications that have a negative influence on these children. Currently, it can be said that there is a potential emergency for violence and poor mental health for the world's next generation of children. It is important for children in the secondary education period (aged 10-19 years) to be provided with education about anti-violence and mental health. At this age, the development of character formation, including physical, emotional and cognitive changes, is very significant. They even tend to seek self-identity and seek superior recognition from their peer group. The provision of educational materials at school is predominantly conventional learning materials such as; scientific educational materials, number calculations, natural knowledge, biology and other scientific materials. It touches very little and does not even provide material about anti-violence and mental health. Most of this education is only used as educational appeals or campaigns during certain events or times. Therefore, it is very important to provide anti-violence and mental health educational material to teenagers simultaneously, especially via smartphone so that they are not burdened with the formal education they receive from school. In fact, these teenagers will get information and even need guidance and direction other than their parents. Health education via smartphone does not only provide informational material, but the application enables the application to become a forum for consultation as well as a place for guidance and seeking protection if a teenager experiences problems with bullying, violence or even poor mental health. One thing that must be understood in this program is that creating professional human resources is not only about being smart in terms of science, but mental and mental health is very bad. It is hoped that this program will be able to have an impact on the beneficiaries, not only school teenagers but also impact teachers, children who cannot afford to go to school and children who are experiencing problems with the law so that they can be coached and reported.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: So far, the HTF program has been dominant in providing educational support, mentoring and training activities to groups at risk of contracting HIV and communities living with HIV. This is strengthened because of financial support from donors which puts more pressure on the beneficiaries directly. Limited funding for program development has not been implemented optimally. If you look closely, the HTF program focuses more on curative treatment for people affected by this problem (especially those infected with HIV), but is very lacking in implementing prevention programs. What must be done if you want to reduce infection and the spread of disease is to stop breaking the chain from the beginning of the source of the problem. This is what the current HTF program needs to prioritize, namely an emphasis on early prevention programs. The YHT program has not directly touched on education about violence (emotional, physical, sexual, etc.) or mental health. However, there are several administrators with professional YHT Human Resources backgrounds who are sometimes invited to be resource persons in providing education related to reproductive health and public health among teenagers/students at universities and in community groups. HTF has limited resources to carry out activity programs for community groups, especially marginalized groups and survivors. Therefore, HTF actively seeks funding support from both national and international donors. Programs that have been implemented over the last 4 years are (1) Caring Response to Overcome Stigma and Discrimination among HIV-AIDS Sufferers through the Central Kalimantan Province Interfaith Forum (2019-2020) which is supported by the Niwano Peace Foundation; (2) HTF took place with several local NGOs to raise funds, food ingredients and Personal Protective Equipment to help Health workers, PLHIV and other marginalized communities affected by Covid-19 socially and economically (2020); (3) Towards Empowered, Productive and Independent PLWHA in Kalimantan (2021-2022) supported by Gilead Inc. Thanks to the support of several international donors, especially Gilead Inc. HTF can be a reference information for individuals, government/private institutions, marginalized communities, especially Peer Support Groups. HTF is also aware of the lack of Human Resources who understand the latest technology. Therefore, the implementation of this program is certainly not only limited to Personal HTF, but will involve professional staff in the field, especially those who understand computer-based program application technology with smartphones. HTF personnel are practitioners, researchers and activists, especially in the health sector. Here there is no need to doubt his ability to analyze phenomena and as a data-based conceptor of community health programs. However, it still has limitations, especially in terms of technology which is developing so rapidly. With partners from government and private institutions as well as educational institutions, can collaborate together to support every program run by HTF.
 Which dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address?: Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).
 Which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals does your solution address?: 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 4. Quality Education, 5. Gender Equality
 What is your solution’s stage of development?: Growth
 Please share details about why you selected the stage above.: So far, the YHT Program has not directly touched on education about violence (emotional, physical, sexual, etc.) or mental health. However, there are several administrators with professional YHT Human Resources backgrounds who are sometimes invited to be resource persons in providing education related to reproductive health and public health among teenagers/students at universities and in community groups. YHT is not yet able to have its own income to run activity programs for community groups, especially marginalized groups and survivors. Therefore, YHT actively seeks funding support from both national and international donors. However, there are several administrators with professional YHT Human Resources backgrounds who are sometimes invited to be resource persons in providing education related to reproductive health and public health among teenagers/students at universities and in community groups. Apart from that, HTF has become a reference center for information, education and assistance for community groups at risk of contracting HIV and for marginalized communities and young people, especially people with HIV.

 Why are you applying to Solve?: As previously explained, the HTF activity program still hopes for proposals for support from donors, especially international donors. So far, local and national government institutions or the private sector have never provided support for the HTF program. Donor support provided by HTF has a short period of 1 year with no opportunity for project extension. HTF realizes that this institution is still small in scale, only accepting a small number of donors. because if you want to get medium and large donors, you definitely have very complete requirements. Currently HTF still has shortcomings in terms of management, especially regarding independent audits, because carrying out independent audits requires quite large costs. Meanwhile, currently we are very limited in carrying out operations in our own office, considering that the staff working at HTF is still project-based only. However, this does not dampen HFT's intention to provide information and support to marginalized groups and communities that we build as grassroots partners.
  HTF really hopes for support from donors who are willing to achieve maximum goals. Therefore, HTF continues to look for international donors who are of course aligned and have the same vision to achieve humanitarian goals. HTF has long had information about SOLVE, and even linked information via HTF emails. There are many opportunities announced by SOLVE, however due to limited HFT personnel it is an obstacle to exploring and preparing complete applications provided by SOLVE. HTF really hopes that through trust and support, SOLVE will be able to bring this organization to receive support from various partners and provide the desired support so that in the future HTF is able to be independent without seeking donor support for each of its programs. HTF still has the burden of running the program, namely the goal of having a special clinic for risk groups, especially HIV and TB and other sexually transmitted diseases. Apart from that, we hope to have a halfway house for individuals and victims of violence, which is currently not available. Because HTF finds many cases, for example there are people who were expelled from their workplace or family without temporary shelter.
 In which of the following areas do you most need partners or support?: Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)
 Who is the Team Lead for your solution?: Dedy, chairperson HTF
 Is the Team Lead a resident of the United States?: No
 Have you or someone else from your organization ever been selected as a Solver for an MIT Solve Global Challenge or for the Indigenous Communities Fellowship?: No
 Explain what makes your solution different from when you or your organization was previously selected.: nan
 Is your solution an active or past participant in another entrepreneurship network? : No, Solve is the first network joined
 Please share the names of the other entrepreneurship networks.: nan
 Did you take the MITx course “Business and Impact Planning for Social Enterprises?” : No, I didn’t take the course
 How did you first hear about Solve?: Email from Solve
 Tell us more about how you found out about Solve’s 2024 Global Challenges.: HTF is a small scale institution, therefore to implement each program it continues to seek support from international donor agencies. SOLVE is one of our findings to get funding support. HTF got information about SOLVE from a Google search for funding opportunities for nonprofit organizations. then follow the instructions to get the latest information linked directly to the HTF email.
 What makes your solution innovative?: The experience of the HTF program in assisting and becoming a center for health information, especially for individuals and groups who have a high risk of transmitting STIs and HIV, has experienced a significant shift in behavior, especially. This is reinforced by the shift in HIV transmission patterns in Indonesia. HIV transmission began in 1990 and was more contagious to gay people, and as time passed in 2000 and transmission increased among female sex workers, including transgender people. Currently (in 2024) transmission is actually increasing again in gay, lesbian and transgender groups. This is where changes in the behavioral orientation of women and men occur. Sexual orientation is everyone's personal right, but healthy sexual behavior is an important thing that needs to be implemented. The solution to emphasize Health Education starting from the younger generation is very important, this must be balanced with current developments, especially the rapid development of technology. As stated at the beginning, it is very useless for us to provide formal education to create quality human resources but not for very poor mental health, soul and personality. This will create more young generations of psychopaths who have problems with violence, stigma and discrimination as well as poor mental health.
  Technology will of course continue to develop, the use of smartphones has now become a habit for everyone in carrying out their activities. It's time for every person and organization to care about saving the younger generation by keeping up with technological developments, starting with the use of smartphones, which need to be equipped with education that educates the current generation of teenagers. It is hoped that smartphone companies and application providers will not only generate financial profits, but are also expected to be able to provide education about health which is currently moving in a far deviant direction. Providing smartphones with applications for health education on anti-violence and mental health will continue to stick in their brains and have an impact on changing behavior towards anti-violence and good mental health. Apart from that, smart phone-based health education can reduce costs quite significantly compared to providing education in the form of mass meetings or through printed books or leaflets/brochures. The use of health education applications can be utilized by school teenagers throughout the world.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: The use of smartphones by children has boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic, and there is even demand (of course there is) for the use of this technology so that it can be used for online learning. It is certain that the use of smartphones can distort their use and even accidentally appear applications that have a negative influence on these children. As long as the HTF program helps treatment programs for STI and HIV risk groups, there is a change in the behavior of the younger generation. This is exacerbated by the explosion in the use of smartphones and applications, causing changes in the behavior of the younger generation to increase. Currently, it can be said that there is a potential emergency for violence and poor mental health for the world's next generation of children. To create quality human resources, it is not enough to simply provide educational materials in schools as formal education that is conventional learning. Therefore, it is very important to provide anti-violence and mental health educational materials to teenagers simultaneously, especially via smartphones so that they are not burdened by the formal education they receive at school. In fact, these teenagers will receive information and even need guidance and direction other than from their parents. Health education via smartphone does not just provide informational material, but this application can be a forum for consultation as well as a forum for guidance and protection if a teenager experiences problems with bullying, violence or even poor mental health. Incorporating anti-violence and mental health educational material via smartphone as part of providing continuous formal learning will restore the behavior of teenagers to become dignified human beings, physically and spiritually healthy.
 What are your impact goals for your solution and how are you measuring your progress towards them?: There have been many changes in the behavior of today's young generation. This is further strengthened by the use of smartphones which has now become a habit in carrying out all activities. Developing when the Covid-19 Pandemic hit the whole world. The use of smartphones needs to be equipped with education that educates the current generation of teenagers.
Therefore, the main aim of this program is to save the younger generation from violent behavior and declining mental health by providing health education through the use of applications on smartphones. Providing health education applications via smartphone can reduce costs significantly compared to providing education in the form of mass meetings or through printed books or leaflets/brochures. The use of health education applications can be utilized by school teenagers throughout the world. This application will of course always be updated regularly based on developments and based on culture in each region.
  
The targets in this program are:
  
Adolescents attending junior high and high school levels, especially throughout Kalimantan Province
  Adolescents (15-19 years) who have dropped out of school, especially throughout Kalimantan Province.
  Teenagers who have problems with the law, especially throughout Kalimantan Province.
  
The indicators in this program are:
  
More than 75% of teenagers attending junior high and high school levels, especially throughout Kalimantan Province, access anti-violence and mental health education applications via smartphone.
  More than 75% of teenagers (15-19 years) who have dropped out of school receive education via smartphone applications from parents, siblings or friends, especially throughout Kalimantan Province.
  More than 75% of teenagers who have problems with the law receive education via smartphone applications from parents, detention center officers, especially throughout Kalimantan Province.
  
It is time for the use of health education applications via smartphones to save a generation of non-violent teenagers without stigma and discrimination and with good mental health.

 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: Technology will continue to develop, especially the use of smartphones which has now become a habit for everyone in carrying out their activities. Especially when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the whole world, using a smartphone was very necessary. Nowadays it is very important to have a smartphone to help with everything. However, it has a huge negative impact if the information in this technology is misused. Especially for today's teenagers, if they don't have supervision and understanding in using smartphones, it will have a bad impact on them.
  Therefore, this project will prioritize the use of smartphones to provide anti-violence and mental health education for youth. This must and needs to continue to be conveyed through applications on smartphones as smartphone-based health education. This educational approach is the same as providing education to teenagers in conventional formal schools, only this educational approach continues to be provided via smartphones. It is not only used to provide education, but also as a place for consultation and communication in emergencies when violence occurs. It is human nature that if information is continuously provided, it will become a habit and be embedded in our memory every time we carry out any activity.
 Which of the following categories best describes your solution?: A new application of an existing technology
 How do you know that this technology works?: nan
 Please select the technologies currently used in your solution:: Software and Mobile Applications
 If your solution has a website, app, or social media handle, provide the link(s) here:: nan
 In which countries do you currently operate?: Indonesia
 Which, if any, additional countries will you be operating in within the next year?: nan
 How many people work on your solution team?: HFT is a small institution that does not have its own funding, and there is still no donor support in its sustainability program. Therefore, daily office operations only rely on 1 staff member and the HFT chairman. Apart from that, HFT is also supported by volunteers from marginalized communities and survivors, especially HIV sufferers. However, if there is donor support, more employees will be involved in carrying out operational activities at the HFT office.
 How long have you been working on your solution? : The HFT program
is currently running as a reference center for information and assistance for
high-risk individuals and groups as well as PLWHA through a very simple
website, especially in Central Kalimantan. regarding this project solution, it
cannot yet be implemented, because there is no funding support, but this
solution becomes input for HFT in every discussion with work partners and
related stakeholders.
 Tell us about how you ensure that your team is diverse, minimizes barriers to opportunity for staff, and provides a welcoming and inclusive environment for all team members.: In carrying out
HFT office operations, we still hope for support from Donors. Without donor
support, so far the HTF has been run directly by the HFT Chair and assisted by
1 permanent staff member in the field of Finance and Administration. Apart from
that, HFT is also supported by colleagues from marginalized communities and
survivors, especially PLWHA. Every time there is donor support there will of
course be additional personnel for that support. In recruiting new staff, HFT
will prioritize staff from marginalized groups such as HIV sufferers who are
still productive, from transgender groups and single parent groups. So far, new
recruitment for HFT employees does not depend on the quantity of education, but
rather on understanding work teams, experience in group communication, without
sigma and discrimination and even a little understanding of the use of
computerized technology. HTF did this because there are still many of them who
need work, besides that they have enthusiasm and are willing to learn in office
organizations and help their colleagues. However, if someone needs expert and
competent staff in a special field, of course job vacancies will be opened
based on separate criteria, especially understanding stigma and discrimination.
 What is your business model?: HTF does not have a business to support its activities and operations. To run office operations, HTF still relies on donations from management and other individuals, while continuing to seek financial support from international donors through calls for proposals.
 Do you primarily provide products or services directly to individuals, to other organizations, or to the government?: nan
 What is your plan for becoming financially sustainable, and what evidence can you provide that this plan has been successful so far?: HTF is still a
small institution, financially unable to build a business to support HFT
programs and operational activities. However, HTf has the enthusiasm to be
financially capable and has sufficient resources to build its business.
Therefore, HFT has a short-term goal, namely building shelters and health
clinics for marginalized communities and groups at high risk of sexually
transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and other diseases. We really hope for
support from international donors to make this happen. With this business, we
are able to carry out every operational activity and HFT program while also
being able to help every underprivileged community in undergoing tests and are
exposed to stigma and discrimination. The long term, HFT also aspires to build
a specialist hospital specifically for post-traumatic and stroke rehabilitation
for marginalized groups and public. This business is very promising, especially
in Kalimantan, because a special hospital like this still doesn't exist and is
very necessary for the community. HTF has studied this for opportunities as
part of HTF's efforts to become independent. Apart from that, this business can
be a support for every individual from marginalized groups who needs work and
protection.","The solution provided aims to address a significant issue of violence, particularly sexual violence, and its consequences on mental health and the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, through an innovative approach using smartphone technology.

84152,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Transforming smartphones into AI-powered cervical screening tools to revolutionize healthcare access in Africa.,"Tunis, Tunisia",Tunisia,Nonprofit,,"<p><a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%20is%20cancer%20that"">Cervical cancer</a> starts in the cervix cells at the lower end of the uterus. This cancer is a pressing public health issue that disproportionately affects women in low-income African communities. In 2018, <a href=""https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%2C%20which%20is%20caused"">all but one of the top 20 countries</a> worldwide with the highest burden of cervical cancer were in Africa. The empirical reality underscores that, although this type of cancer is among the most preventable, limited access to prevention, screening, and treatment services results in <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer"">90% of deaths</a>. </p>
<p>One of the most significant challenges in addressing this issue <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer"">is the limited access to essential preventive healthcare</a> services, including human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations and preventive screenings. In many African countries, healthcare infrastructure is either <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35105635/"">underdeveloped or inaccessible</a> to impoverished people. This lack of access leads to late diagnoses, where treatment options are <a href=""https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%2C%20which%20is%20caused"">limited and less effective</a>. The shortage of pathologists in Africa exacerbates a dire healthcare situation, particularly in cancer diagnosis and treatment. For instance, a report on radiation services in Nigeria—a country with a population of <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27446806/"">160 million and an estimated 100,000 new cancer cases annually</a>—revealed a staggering lack of specialized medical professionals. The entire nation had only <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27446806/"">18 radiation oncologists, 8 medical physicists, and 18 radiation therapists</a> to meet its radiation therapy needs . This scarcity often leads to misdiagnosis, as generalists who lack specialized training in pathology are left to handle complex cases. The result is delayed or incorrect treatment and a <a href=""https://www.who.int/activities/promoting-cancer-early-diagnosis"">missed opportunity for early intervention</a>. </p>
<p>Early prevention, including HPV vaccination and early diagnosis, is crucial for cervical cancer. However, African countries are currently not meeting the World Health Organization (WHO)'s 2030 targets for prevention and treatment, including a 9<a href=""https://www.who.int/initiatives/cervical-cancer-elimination-initiative"">0% HPV vaccination rate by age 15, a 70% screening rate between ages 35 and 45, and a 90% treatment rate</a>. The 5-year survival rate for cervical cancer in Africa <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9683338/"">is below 50%</a> , which is in stark contrast to the survival rate of <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/survival#:~:text=The%205-year%20relative%20survival%20rates%20for%20cervical%20cancer%20are"">over 65%</a> in developed countries.

<p><strong><br /></strong></p>","<p>Our solution, CerviScanner, revolutionizes cervical cancer detection by leveraging AI technology to transform any smartphone into an effective screening tool. This innovative approach stands in stark contrast to costly alternatives such as telepathology, which can incur expenses <a href=""https://www.ahb.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Country-Overview_Kenya.pdf"">up to $120M for software alone in a country like Kenya</a>, and digital microscopes, averaging around $1,500 per unit—costs that are prohibitive for many healthcare sites within the African context.</p>
<p>In contrast, our app is accessible, offered for free, and integrates seamlessly with existing microscopes at no additional cost. This ensures widespread adoption is feasible and realistic across diverse healthcare settings. By utilizing smartphones, our app bypasses the need for expensive digitalizing equipment or new hardware. This not only reduces direct costs significantly compared to other methods but also speeds up the diagnosis process, eliminating the need for specialist intervention and the associated wait times.</p>
<p>Our app is designed to be compatible with a minimum camera resolution of 8 megapixels and works with both Android and iOS systems, ensuring broad usability. It functions effectively with conventional microscopes available in all hospital laboratories in Tunisia. CerviScanner is designed to function even when there is no internet connection. In such scenarios, the app will automatically save the microscope picture and store it locally on the device. Once an internet connection is re-established, the app will automatically upload the saved picture to the server. </p>
<p>In terms of catalyzing broader positive impacts, our reach and data collection are exponential. Starting with 20 facilities in Tunisia and expanding to 80, with every facility conducting around 20 screenings/ day, we expect to conduct over 1 million tests across Africa within three years. This volume of data will refine our AI for greater precision, create cost savings for healthcare systems, and most importantly, save lives. The ripple effect of our app has the potential to set a new paradigm in healthcare efficiency and community empowerment, showcasing a sustainable model for global health initiatives.</p>","<p>CerviScanner leverages AI technology to enhance early detection of cervical cancer efficiently and affordably.

 In what country is your solution team headquartered?: Tunisia
 What type of organization is your solution team?: Nonprofit
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: nan
 What specific problem are you solving?: Cervical cancer starts in the cervix cells at the lower end of the uterus. This cancer is a pressing public health issue that disproportionately affects women in low-income African communities. In 2018, all but one of the top 20 countries worldwide with the highest burden of cervical cancer were in Africa. The empirical reality underscores that, although this type of cancer is among the most preventable, limited access to prevention, screening, and treatment services results in 90% of deaths. 
One of the most significant challenges in addressing this issue is the limited access to essential preventive healthcare services, including human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations and preventive screenings. In many African countries, healthcare infrastructure is either underdeveloped or inaccessible to impoverished people. This lack of access leads to late diagnoses, where treatment options are limited and less effective. The shortage of pathologists in Africa exacerbates a dire healthcare situation, particularly in cancer diagnosis and treatment. For instance, a report on radiation services in Nigeria—a country with a population of 160 million and an estimated 100,000 new cancer cases annually—revealed a staggering lack of specialized medical professionals. The entire nation had only 18 radiation oncologists, 8 medical physicists, and 18 radiation therapists to meet its radiation therapy needs . This scarcity often leads to misdiagnosis, as generalists who lack specialized training in pathology are left to handle complex cases. The result is delayed or incorrect treatment and a missed opportunity for early intervention. 
Early prevention, including HPV vaccination and early diagnosis, is crucial for cervical cancer. However, African countries are currently not meeting the World Health Organization (WHO)'s 2030 targets for prevention and treatment, including a 90% HPV vaccination rate by age 15, a 70% screening rate between ages 35 and 45, and a 90% treatment rate. The 5-year survival rate for cervical cancer in Africa is below 50% , which is in stark contrast to the survival rate of over 65% in developed countries. Innovative solutions are urgently needed to address unique challenges in low-income African communities. A multidimensional approach prioritizing early-phase screening for African women can significantly reduce mortality rates, aligning with WHO's ambitious goals.
 What is your solution?: We designed a mobile application, “CerviScanner”, to screen for cervical cancer among African women aged 21 to 69. The app works as an intelligent screening assistant for healthcare professionals (HPs). A HP places the smartphone camera lens over the eyepiece of a microscope, which is focused on a Pap smear slide. The app captures the image and uses a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to analyze the cellular structures for abnormalities indicative of cervical cancer. The results are then displayed on the app's interface, providing immediate, actionable insights for the HP. The mobile app is a screening tool that eliminates the need for additional hardware or computer systems. We trained our app on thousands of cervical smear test images after a thorough four-phase research methodology. The latter included dataset collection, pre-processing, predictive model selection, and code implementation. Our algorithms have reached an accuracy rate of 89% in uncontrolled settings. Our demo is accessible here. 
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : Our initial target is 5 million women aged 21 to 69 in Tunisia. The next phase will expand the application to Kenya, targeting 16.8 million women at risk of developing cervical cancer , followed by an outreach to 4.35 million women in Rwanda. Ultimately, our objective is to focus on women in the remaining top ten Sub-Saharan African countries with the highest rates of cervical cancer, including Eswatini, Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Uganda, Comoros, Mozambique, and Guinea. 
A poignant example of the pressing need for our solution comes from South Africa, where women are typically asked to return to their primary healthcare clinic within 6 to 8 weeks just to receive Pap smear results. Those identified with abnormalities face an additional wait of 1 to 8 months for a colposcopy appointment. It is in this gap of time where the danger lies and where our solution intervenes. By implementing CerviScanner, the time from test to results can be reduced to 1-2 hours, allowing HPs to make immediate and informed decisions about the next steps in patient care. Our approach not only shortens the diagnosis timeline but also increases the volume of screenings, providing a significant boost in early detection rates and the potential to save lives.
As we look to bring preventive measures that are both cost-effective and sustainable, we anticipate a broad-scale impact that aligns with global health advancement goals. Our comprehensive approach is designed to be a game-changer in the regions we aim to serve. Over the next three years alone, we estimate reaching 2 million women across Africa, substantially improving access to care and contributing to the global fight against cervical cancer.

 What makes your solution innovative?: Our solution, CerviScanner, revolutionizes cervical cancer detection by leveraging AI technology to transform any smartphone into an effective screening tool. This innovative approach stands in stark contrast to costly alternatives such as telepathology, which can incur expenses up to $120M for software alone in a country like Kenya, and digital microscopes, averaging around $1,500 per unit—costs that are prohibitive for many healthcare sites within the African context.
In contrast, our app is accessible, offered for free, and integrates seamlessly with existing microscopes at no additional cost. This ensures widespread adoption is feasible and realistic across diverse healthcare settings. By utilizing smartphones, our app bypasses the need for expensive digitalizing equipment or new hardware. This not only reduces direct costs significantly compared to other methods but also speeds up the diagnosis process, eliminating the need for specialist intervention and the associated wait times.
Our app is designed to be compatible with a minimum camera resolution of 8 megapixels and works with both Android and iOS systems, ensuring broad usability. It functions effectively with conventional microscopes available in all hospital laboratories in Tunisia. CerviScanner is designed to function even when there is no internet connection. In such scenarios, the app will automatically save the microscope picture and store it locally on the device. Once an internet connection is re-established, the app will automatically upload the saved picture to the server. 
In terms of catalyzing broader positive impacts, our reach and data collection are exponential. Starting with 20 facilities in Tunisia and expanding to 80, with every facility conducting around 20 screenings/ day, we expect to conduct over 1 million tests across Africa within three years. This volume of data will refine our AI for greater precision, create cost savings for healthcare systems, and most importantly, save lives. The ripple effect of our app has the potential to set a new paradigm in healthcare efficiency and community empowerment, showcasing a sustainable model for global health initiatives.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: CerviScanner leverages AI technology to enhance early detection of cervical cancer efficiently and affordably. Below is an outline of our Theory of change, detailed in the accompanying image, which describes how we plan to transform cervical cancer screening practices across Africa.
Inputs: Our initiative leverages critical resources including funding, machine learning expertise, local healthcare partnerships, cloud infrastructure, and dedicated personnel.

Activities: Key activities involve:Refining our app’s accuracy.Integrating user feedback for continuous improvement.Collaborating with healthcare facilities to ensure seamless integration.Forming an Expert Committee with diverse healthcare stakeholders.Evaluating our impact using specific KPIs.

Outputs: Initially, the app will be deployed in 20 facilities in Tunisia, expanding to 40 in Tunisia and Kenya by the second year, with a marked increase in screenings.

Mid-term and ultimate outcomes: We aim to increase screening rates from their current level &lt;30% to 50% by year one and 70% by year two. This objective resonates with the WHO’s recommendations. Ultimately, we strive to raise the five-year survival rate for cervical cancer from below 50% to at least 60%, bringing it closer to international standards. This will significantly reduce morbidity and mortality, and improve equitable access to cancer care across diverse communities.


 What are your impact goals for your solution and how are you measuring your progress towards them?: Our solution’s impact goals are tightly interwoven with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, (SDG) and particularly SDG 3, underscoring our commitment to improving health outcomes through increased access to and quality of healthcare services. We will use these KPIs To measure our progress:
Screening frequency: we monitor screenings through our app's backend, collecting real-time usage data to assess our reach and gauge the potential reduction in premature mortality.Diagnostic accuracy: to support universal health coverage as outlined in SDG target 3.8, diagnostic outcomes from our app are cross-referenced with medical records from healthcare facilities, ensuring accurate and reliable diagnostics.Early interventions: tracking early interventions in line with SDG target 3.4, we gather data from healthcare providers' records, enabling us to evaluate the effectiveness of early treatments that our app facilitates.Mortality rate: our contribution to SDG target 3.4 extends to studying mortality trends through public health records, which informs the long-term impact of our solution on reducing cervical cancer mortality rates.User satisfaction: we conduct periodic surveys with users and HPs to ensure the app delivers a satisfactory and effective user experience.
Data from these various sources allows us to closely monitor our KPIs, not only to measure our app’s direct impact but also to continually refine our approach. This ensures that as we scale, our strategies remain data-driven, user-focused, and aligned with the global and sustainable health advancements.
 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: Our model has been trained using 2 robust publicly available datasets that include 1,415 images, categorized under The Bethesda System. These images, sourced from real-world clinical settings, ensure our model is both relevant and effectively tuned for precision in medical diagnostics.
The AI model operates through a series of sophisticated steps beginning with image preprocessing, where images are resized, cropped, and formatted to optimize analysis. Feature extraction follows, with the AI identifying crucial image characteristics such as edges, colors, and textures. These features are essential for the model to recognize various stages of cervical lesions. During the training phase, the model adjusts its parameters to reduce errors and improve its ability to predict pre-cancerous and cancerous conditions accurately.
Once trained, the model applies its refined algorithms to new images, making predictions based on learned patterns. Post-processing of predictions enhances accuracy and reliability by filtering out uncertain results and refining the diagnosis. Beyond simple image classification, the model also supports object detection, image segmentation, and even image restoration—capabilities that broaden its applicability and effectiveness in medical imaging tasks.
Supporting the AI model is a robust backend infrastructure designed around a microservices architecture orchestrated by Kubernetes, which ensures scalability and reliability. This setup manages various functions from handling user requests to processing complex data efficiently. Our system employs cloud services including Kubernetes for automated deployment and scaling, PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and management, and GPU-accelerated virtual machines that provide the necessary computational power for intensive data processing and model training.
To further enhance the algorithm, we have incorporated pilot data collected from 189 samples across two hospitals in Tunisia, enabling us to refine the model with direct input from local real-world scenarios. This practical validation helps ensure that our application is not only theoretically sound but also effective in everyday clinical use.

84162,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,"We propose a scalable, multilingual technology driven patient support chatbot and online resource to improve the quality of patient support for TB.","Delhi, India",India,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>Tuberculosis (TB) though curable is a global pandemic, and claimed approximately 1.3 million lives in 2022 alone. India is considered the global TB epicenter with an estimated 480,000 Indians dying of TB annually,  and about 1,400 deaths daily. In India and elsewhere,  TB care is fraught with challenges especially a lack of patient support and  disease literacy among those affected. Also, TB diagnosis is challenging, and treatment is prolonged, toxic, and fraught with severe side effects, compounded by deep social stigma and significant mental health repercussions. Through our solution, we wish to address the lack of comprehensive, empathetic and accessible patient support and disease literacy among TB affected individuals and their families in India and South Asia.</p>
<p>Why is this important? It is critical as TB disproportionately affects the poor, vulnerable, urban migrants, women, and those residing in informal settlements in burgeoning urban centers, where overcrowding, migration, and poor nutrition accelerate  TB transmission but access to support and appropriate care is limited.</p>
<p>TB care paradigms, both in high burden countries like India and globally, lack effective solutions to provide critical patient support , information,  and guidance, to TB-affected individuals and families. Thus, current TB care in many countries is characterized by no patient support, lack of information, stigmatizing, and dehumanizing practices, leading to delayed diagnosis, treatment complexities, stigma, and exacerbated mental health (MH) challenges. These gaps  stem from an overemphasis on medicalized approaches, information asymmetry, and a lack of  person-centered supportive care. This lack of support, information, and guidance makes care unresponsive, diminishes human agency, fosters social and self-stigma, impacts treatment adherence, and overall health outcomes. This often makes TB unmanageable, especially for marginalized and vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Globally, TB remains the foremost global killer. India bears the highest TB burden globally, and  its urbanizing cities have become  epicenters of this epidemic. Research tells us TB is a biosocial disease extensively affecting migrants, the poor, and minorities. TB care in India lacks patient support, guidance, open communication, side effect management, and mental health assistance. Contributing factors to this problem include:</p>
<ul><li><p>Uninformed, unsupportive care: Affected Individuals have inadequate information on TB disease, its diagnosis and treatment, compounded by the health workforce's dismissive attitude towards patient concerns, along with stigma, side effects, and MH issues.</p></li><li><p>Access barriers: Socio-economic disparities, geographical hurdles, systemic gender biases within communities and health systems, impede timely access to TB diagnosis, treatment, and support services, especially for marginalized and underserved populations.</p></li><li><p>Limited community involvement: The healthcare system often disregards patient concerns, resulting in gaps in disease understanding, perpetuating self-stigma and information asymmetry.</p></li><li><p>Insufficient health provider Capacity: TB care primarily focuses on diagnosis and treatment adherence, neglecting patient needs. Healthcare providers lack adequate training in providing support and person-centered care</p></li><li><p>Misinformation &amp; Stigma: Religious and social myths and misinformation regarding TB exacerbates stigma and mental health challenges. The lack of accurate information, and disease literacy, coupled with social isolation impacts TB-affected individuals and their families.</p></li></ul>","<p>Our solution is an integrated multilingual patient support platform, which includes a) WhatsApp chatbot and b) a YouTube channel to deliver multilingual information, guidance and psychosocial support for TB-affected individuals. Informed by survivor-led definitions of quality care, the community action model (Freire, 1974), and the behavior change wheel (Michie et al., 2014), our program aims to engage, inform and empower TB affected to enhance their TB care comprehensively.</p>
<p>As a TB-affected individual, our WhatsApp chatbot and online resources will provide reliable disease information, diagnosis, treatment guidance, and strategies for addressing stigma and MH challenges. It will address user queries in real-time allowing them continuous information  and support. Also, users will also access survivor stories, films about recovery from TB,  guided learning for self-care, stigma coping strategies, treatment management, to make management of TB disease easier. All of this will make care more TB care more person-centered, improve motivation, reduce stigma and help recognize and manage emerging MH challenges. For vulnerable groups such as urban migrants, women who lack control on their care and LGBTQIA++ individuals who fear interacting with the health system, this becomes an empathetic companion providing support at all times. Every time you have a query or a side effect, you will be able to receive information, guidance and support on it, with textual and  audio visual resources. </p>
<p>This program will be developed using participatory methods derived from the principles of the community action model and design thinking. We will conduct community needs and perspectives assessment on TB support. This collaborative approach ensures people-centered design and content addressing specific challenges identified by the community. The content development will involve experts, survivors, and health providers, ensuring accuracy, relevance, and accessibility.</p>
<p>Guided by the behavior change wheel, our approach facilitates the design of evidence-based interventions to support behavior change. Our work aligns with NICE guidance (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2009), emphasizing addressing patient perceptions alongside practical issues. Research underscores the critical role of community engagement, information, and support in enhancing the patient experience (Mehra, 2021).</p>
<p>Mobile technology, particularly WhatsApp, plays a pivotal role in providing accessible, confidential support. Utilizing an easily accessible online platform ensures scalability, while multilingual survivor-led content enhances audience connection. By empowering communities and strengthening healthcare systems, our program aims to eliminate TB as a public health threat.</p>
<p>By combining community-led design, evidence-based interventions, and technology-driven solutions, our program represents a comprehensive approach to improving TB care and ultimately working towards the eradication of TB as a global health threat.</p>","<p>Our solution serves two primary groups: TB-affected individuals, and their families with access to the internet and their own mobile phones. We are targeting India for the launch of our program but it has the potential to serve TB affected individuals across South Asia, especially in high burden countries.  </p>
<p>India had 2.8 million TB cases in 2022, with a case fatality ratio of 12 per cent. TB in this region primarily affects poor and vulnerable groups especially those without formal employment, limited access to health services often living in crowded urban centers and or extremely poor regions. These populations are often beset with overcrowding, poverty and air pollution which are amongst the most common determinants of TB. TB affected populations present a terrifying picture of death, devastation, poverty, and suffering.
</p>
<p>This intervention for support is urgently needed from the patient and community perspective. This is because both in the public but also the private sector - where more than 60% of Indians seek treatment -here currently exist no support or information mechanisms for TB affected individuals and their families. Inaccurate diagnosis, treatment, misinformation, stigma is common and can cause economic, physical and mental distress.</p>
<p>Using this disease data and vast mobile and internet penetration rates (April-June 2023, the total internet connections in India are 895.83 million, TRAI), we estimate that there are between 50-60 % TB affected individuals, who will have sufficient mobile access to engage with our solution in India alone. Our program will particularly benefit urban migrants that are usually poor  in cities such as Mumbai, Delhi and Pune that have become hubs of drug sensitive (DS) and drug resistant (DR) TB. </p>
<p>Their needs are currently underserved because TB care is neither person-centered,  nor is it responsive to needs of patient support. With a focus only on diagnosis and treatment, care is not geared toward addressing the informational, social, systemic, economic and mental health challenges that TB affected individuals and their families face. Thus any form of patient support is extremely difficult to access for those affected but especially difficult for low-income, low-literacy groups, women, sexual and gender minorities who are TB affected and face stigma, discrimination and even abuse from communities and the health system. They remain passive recipients without access to accessible information, support, guidance and dignified, non-stigmatizing care.</p>
<p>Our solution will address their needs by providing them with disease  information, managing treatment, accessing support narratives and guidance on how to address issues of side effects, nutritional advice, and also provide support and strategies for stigma mitigation. This will be done through a WhatsApp chatbot in real time, as well as our YouTube channel. <br /></p>
<p>We expect that by engaging with our program and its service, patient users will be able to a)increase disease literacy and understanding, b) demonstrate capacity to manage the severity of symptoms of side effects, c) recognize, manage and seek help for associated MH problems such as depression, anxiety and stress, and have d) reduced self-stigma.<br /></p>","<p>Our team is uniquely positioned to design and deliver this solution to the target population. Pi has been a leader in community engagement and designing community-led care in TB, COVID-19, and HIV.

We've selected the ""Growth"" stage for our solution.</p>
<p>Currently, our program टीबी पे चर्चा (Talking TB) is a solution available in multiple communities, offering limited patient support and comprehensive education on TB-related issues. This has also been used by partners on the ground, the government and the private sector.  We have developed and tested a range of resources, including multilingual patient education films, support materials, and interactive workshops, all available in five languages (English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and Malayalam).</p>
<p>Since its inception, our initiative has reached a significant number of beneficiaries (close to 4 million) from TB affected communities across various regions. This however represents a consolidated number and may have users visiting the program multiple times. Moreover, we do not have figures from the government  or the private sector on their usage under their programs. Through these efforts, we have provided essential information, guidance  and support to TB patients and their families, empowering them to effectively manage TB and overcome associated challenges.</p>
<p>Additionally, our unique survivor-led approach has resonated with our target audience, fostering trust and credibility within the communities we serve. We have received positive feedback and testimonials from participants, indicating the impact and effectiveness of our program in addressing their needs and concerns related to TB.</p>
<p>As we continue to grow, we aim to expand our reach and impact by scaling our program in different languages (adapting and expanding to 10) and formats to reach more communities and individuals in need by covering a larger set of issues. By leveraging our existing experience, infrastructure, partnerships, and resources, we are poised for further growth and are committed to making a meaningful difference in the fight against TB.</p>
<p>Our focus on scalability, sustainability, and impact measurement ensures that we can effectively drive positive change in TB-affected communities.</p>","<p>We are relatively new in expanding the program and it's still in its early stages of development and expansion to the next phase. While we have extensive experience in working with communities and stakeholders  and capacity to deliver, we need support, strategic advice, guidance on technology and funding for expanding the program and making it more broad based, inclusive and targeted. We also need support to strategize and establish the necessary infrastructure to  fully realize this solution's potential in the South Asia region and perhaps consider new geographies as well. Here the MIT Solve team and the faculty at MIT would be particularly helpful. This is especially important as in high TB-burden, low and income economies the focus on care paradigms which focus on patient support are limited. </p>
<p>We are already establishing collaborations with the public sector and also private sector stakeholders. However, working with governments and the private sector also needs considerable  strategic thinking and planning and we would appreciate inputs on this. This support will allow us to expand the reach of this solution with partners in other countries as well with similar disease burden and or linguistic and cultural similarities. They can take this solution to the affected communities and amplify its reach while also providing guidance on the best practices with patients.</p>

Yet its single biggest gap remains the lack of person-centered patient support services. Even today millions of TB  affected individuals still grapple with a lack of support, information, and guidance, making the treatment journey and its associated challenges insurmountable. Our solution seeks to innovatively invert the care paradigm by placing TB-affected individuals at the center, providing them information and support, motivation and guidance thereby building their capacity to make them capable  to address  and manage their disease  and its associated care challenges effectively. By creating an easily accessible, multilingual,  patient support platform that provides those affected with support, guidance and information in local languages through pervasive technological platforms, we aim to transform their ability to manage treatment, and side effects, MH challenges and seek reliable care. This person-centered approach fosters a sense of ownership over one's health, enabling individuals to take proactive steps about their health and seek assistance when needed.</p>
<p>Millions of TB-affected individuals face barriers such as social stigma, mental health challenges, and difficulties managing treatment side effects. Our solution directly  addresses these issues, with the aim to transform the patient experience  through support and information s in diverse, multilingual countries like India and elsewhere. Our innovative approach in health information delivery, patient support, and adherence through digital channels has the ability to transform the TB patient experience safely and confidentially .</p>

By doing so, we address systemic gaps and promote personalized, culturally relevant health information and support, with the aim to improve treatment adherence, reduce stigma, and mitigate MH challenges associated with TB.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional top-down approaches, our solution embraces a community- and person-centered design approach, actively involving TB-affected individuals in the design and delivery of support. This is a community led and represented initiative, where communities share stories, motivate and guide through audio visual and textual aids. By prioritizing community voices and preferences, we ensure that TB support and care paradigms are tailored to create a community connect and meet unique needs and cultural contexts, resulting in effective support that enhances patient  responsiveness  and treatment adherence.</p>
<p>Additionally, our solution addresses economic barriers to support and information  by democratizing access to high-quality support and information in the local language with visual aids regardless of economic status or literacy. Leveraging technology to overcome geographical barriers, we promote healthcare access for remote and underserved populations anywhere they may be and  build their capacity to manage their care.</p>
<p>Our solution is not just a simple and easy innovation but one that harnesses the power of universal technology access and combines it with the inputs and lived experiences of community engagement to transform the TB care experience for all irrespective economic, linguistic, geographical, or cultural barriers.<br /></p>","<p>Our theory of change revolves around the notion that by providing comprehensive, community-designed, and multilingual psychosocial support to TB-affected individuals, we can catalyze positive shifts in mental health outcomes and treatment adherence.</p>
<p>Drawing upon principles from the community action model (Freire, 1974), and the behavior change wheel (Michie et al, 2014), our solution aims to address the root causes of poor TB care paradigms such as lack of patient support, misinformation and associated challenges of stigma, MH and limited community involvement.</p>
<p> Our theory of change is premised on the following: </p>
<p>1) Through engagement with our WhatsApp chatbot and utilization of online resources, TB-affected individuals gain access to reliable information, guidance, and support tailored to their specific needs and challenges.</p>
<p>2) Through our community-designed support program, which includes self-guided activities and interactive modules, TB affected individuals develop coping skills, reduce self-stigma and manage their mental health. </p>
<p>3) The outcome of these two interventions will be that TB affected individuals will be informed,  and feel empowered to actively manage their TB care journey effectively.</p>
<p>Our  strategy emphasizes participatory methods and design thinking to ensure the program's relevance and effectiveness within diverse TB-affected communities.  Our TOC is premised on the participative model as collaboration with TB clinical experts, communication specialists, and healthcare providers further enhances the program's impact and scalability. Leveraging mobile technology and digital health platforms, we aim to facilitate accessible, real time patient support and guidance, ultimately redefining care approaches and driving positive outcomes in the fight against TB. </p>

 What type of organization is your solution team?: For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: nan
 What specific problem are you solving?: Tuberculosis (TB) though curable is a global pandemic, and claimed approximately 1.3 million lives in 2022 alone. India is considered the global TB epicenter with an estimated 480,000 Indians dying of TB annually,  and about 1,400 deaths daily. In India and elsewhere,  TB care is fraught with challenges especially a lack of patient support and  disease literacy among those affected. Also, TB diagnosis is challenging, and treatment is prolonged, toxic, and fraught with severe side effects, compounded by deep social stigma and significant mental health repercussions. Through our solution, we wish to address the lack of comprehensive, empathetic and accessible patient support and disease literacy among TB affected individuals and their families in India and South Asia.
Why is this important? It is critical as TB disproportionately affects the poor, vulnerable, urban migrants, women, and those residing in informal settlements in burgeoning urban centers, where overcrowding, migration, and poor nutrition accelerate  TB transmission but access to support and appropriate care is limited.
TB care paradigms, both in high burden countries like India and globally, lack effective solutions to provide critical patient support , information,  and guidance, to TB-affected individuals and families. Thus, current TB care in many countries is characterized by no patient support, lack of information, stigmatizing, and dehumanizing practices, leading to delayed diagnosis, treatment complexities, stigma, and exacerbated mental health (MH) challenges. These gaps  stem from an overemphasis on medicalized approaches, information asymmetry, and a lack of  person-centered supportive care. This lack of support, information, and guidance makes care unresponsive, diminishes human agency, fosters social and self-stigma, impacts treatment adherence, and overall health outcomes. This often makes TB unmanageable, especially for marginalized and vulnerable populations.
Globally, TB remains the foremost global killer. India bears the highest TB burden globally, and  its urbanizing cities have become  epicenters of this epidemic. Research tells us TB is a biosocial disease extensively affecting migrants, the poor, and minorities. TB care in India lacks patient support, guidance, open communication, side effect management, and mental health assistance. Contributing factors to this problem include:
Uninformed, unsupportive care: Affected Individuals have inadequate information on TB disease, its diagnosis and treatment, compounded by the health workforce's dismissive attitude towards patient concerns, along with stigma, side effects, and MH issues.Access barriers: Socio-economic disparities, geographical hurdles, systemic gender biases within communities and health systems, impede timely access to TB diagnosis, treatment, and support services, especially for marginalized and underserved populations.Limited community involvement: The healthcare system often disregards patient concerns, resulting in gaps in disease understanding, perpetuating self-stigma and information asymmetry.Insufficient health provider Capacity: TB care primarily focuses on diagnosis and treatment adherence, neglecting patient needs. Healthcare providers lack adequate training in providing support and person-centered careMisinformation &amp; Stigma: Religious and social myths and misinformation regarding TB exacerbates stigma and mental health challenges. The lack of accurate information, and disease literacy, coupled with social isolation impacts TB-affected individuals and their families.
 What is your solution?: Our solution is an integrated multilingual patient support platform, which includes a) WhatsApp chatbot and b) a YouTube channel to deliver multilingual information, guidance and psychosocial support for TB-affected individuals. Informed by survivor-led definitions of quality care, the community action model (Freire, 1974), and the behavior change wheel (Michie et al., 2014), our program aims to engage, inform and empower TB affected to enhance their TB care comprehensively.
As a TB-affected individual, our WhatsApp chatbot and online resources will provide reliable disease information, diagnosis, treatment guidance, and strategies for addressing stigma and MH challenges. It will address user queries in real-time allowing them continuous information  and support. Also, users will also access survivor stories, films about recovery from TB,  guided learning for self-care, stigma coping strategies, treatment management, to make management of TB disease easier. All of this will make care more TB care more person-centered, improve motivation, reduce stigma and help recognize and manage emerging MH challenges. For vulnerable groups such as urban migrants, women who lack control on their care and LGBTQIA++ individuals who fear interacting with the health system, this becomes an empathetic companion providing support at all times. Every time you have a query or a side effect, you will be able to receive information, guidance and support on it, with textual and  audio visual resources. 
This program will be developed using participatory methods derived from the principles of the community action model and design thinking. We will conduct community needs and perspectives assessment on TB support. This collaborative approach ensures people-centered design and content addressing specific challenges identified by the community. The content development will involve experts, survivors, and health providers, ensuring accuracy, relevance, and accessibility.
Guided by the behavior change wheel, our approach facilitates the design of evidence-based interventions to support behavior change. Our work aligns with NICE guidance (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2009), emphasizing addressing patient perceptions alongside practical issues. Research underscores the critical role of community engagement, information, and support in enhancing the patient experience (Mehra, 2021).
Mobile technology, particularly WhatsApp, plays a pivotal role in providing accessible, confidential support. Utilizing an easily accessible online platform ensures scalability, while multilingual survivor-led content enhances audience connection. By empowering communities and strengthening healthcare systems, our program aims to eliminate TB as a public health threat.
By combining community-led design, evidence-based interventions, and technology-driven solutions, our program represents a comprehensive approach to improving TB care and ultimately working towards the eradication of TB as a global health threat.
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : Our solution serves two primary groups: TB-affected individuals, and their families with access to the internet and their own mobile phones. We are targeting India for the launch of our program but it has the potential to serve TB affected individuals across South Asia, especially in high burden countries.  
India had 2.8 million TB cases in 2022, with a case fatality ratio of 12 per cent. TB in this region primarily affects poor and vulnerable groups especially those without formal employment, limited access to health services often living in crowded urban centers and or extremely poor regions. These populations are often beset with overcrowding, poverty and air pollution which are amongst the most common determinants of TB. TB affected populations present a terrifying picture of death, devastation, poverty, and suffering.

This intervention for support is urgently needed from the patient and community perspective. This is because both in the public but also the private sector - where more than 60% of Indians seek treatment -here currently exist no support or information mechanisms for TB affected individuals and their families. Inaccurate diagnosis, treatment, misinformation, stigma is common and can cause economic, physical and mental distress.
Using this disease data and vast mobile and internet penetration rates (April-June 2023, the total internet connections in India are 895.83 million, TRAI), we estimate that there are between 50-60 % TB affected individuals, who will have sufficient mobile access to engage with our solution in India alone. Our program will particularly benefit urban migrants that are usually poor  in cities such as Mumbai, Delhi and Pune that have become hubs of drug sensitive (DS) and drug resistant (DR) TB. 
Their needs are currently underserved because TB care is neither person-centered,  nor is it responsive to needs of patient support. With a focus only on diagnosis and treatment, care is not geared toward addressing the informational, social, systemic, economic and mental health challenges that TB affected individuals and their families face. Thus any form of patient support is extremely difficult to access for those affected but especially difficult for low-income, low-literacy groups, women, sexual and gender minorities who are TB affected and face stigma, discrimination and even abuse from communities and the health system. They remain passive recipients without access to accessible information, support, guidance and dignified, non-stigmatizing care.
Our solution will address their needs by providing them with disease  information, managing treatment, accessing support narratives and guidance on how to address issues of side effects, nutritional advice, and also provide support and strategies for stigma mitigation. This will be done through a WhatsApp chatbot in real time, as well as our YouTube channel. 
We expect that by engaging with our program and its service, patient users will be able to a)increase disease literacy and understanding, b) demonstrate capacity to manage the severity of symptoms of side effects, c) recognize, manage and seek help for associated MH problems such as depression, anxiety and stress, and have d) reduced self-stigma.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: Our team is uniquely positioned to design and deliver this solution to the target population. Pi has been a leader in community engagement and designing community-led care in TB, COVID-19, and HIV. Our team lead, Chapal Mehra, founded India's leading TB Community advocacy patient group, Survivors Against TB (SATB), pioneering the community-led paradigm of care in TB.
Pi created India's first expert, advocate, survivor, and community-led advocacy and patient support online program called TB pe Charcha. Our transformative work in community engagement has established a participatory design paradigm in policy and programs in South Asia. With close to two decades of experience working with TB and HIV communities, our team has a strong focus on policy, program design, and patient support. We advocate that TB is a biosocial disease that requires people-centered policies, programs, and solutions. Our work emphasizes that clinical expertise, along with lived experiences of diseases, should guide disease communication, program, and care design. 
The initiative integrates two key aspects in its programming: expertise by lived experience and expertise by clinical expertise. Building on our earlier work, where we launched India's first patient education and support program, TB pe Charcha, which eventually reached close to 4 million people on YouTube alone. Additionally, we have amongst the largest cohort of national and international TB advocates and survivors and collaborate with leading TB clinicians and experts in India and globally. Our work is founded on the principles of community action as a route to improved quality of care.
Our content design team, led by Vashita Madan, has extensive expertise in health communication design and working with communities. With over seven years of experience in TB issues, our team excels in public health awareness, communication, advocacy, and patient support program design for vulnerable groups and diverse audiences. We are currently working on multiple sustained, long-term phased communication and sensitization campaigns.
M Raza, who leads our technology efforts, brings a background in data science, technology for innovation, and the development of public-facing technology solutions. 
Moreover, Pi is uniquely positioned to collaborate with other key stakeholders such as national and state governments and the private sector. We have developed multilingual digital programs focusing on themes like women and TB, mental health and TB, stigma, treatment, and diagnosis, with a strong emphasis on vulnerable populations, especially women and trans communities.
Our diverse collaborators and key stakeholders represent a cross-section of experiences and skills in creating public narratives, with a strong focus on public health awareness. 
 Which dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address?: Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).
 Which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals does your solution address?: 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 5. Gender Equality, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 17. Partnerships for the Goals
 What is your solution’s stage of development?: Growth
 Please share details about why you selected the stage above.: 
We've selected the ""Growth"" stage for our solution.
Currently, our program टीबी पे चर्चा (Talking TB) is a solution available in multiple communities, offering limited patient support and comprehensive education on TB-related issues. This has also been used by partners on the ground, the government and the private sector.  We have developed and tested a range of resources, including multilingual patient education films, support materials, and interactive workshops, all available in five languages (English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and Malayalam).
Since its inception, our initiative has reached a significant number of beneficiaries (close to 4 million) from TB affected communities across various regions. This however represents a consolidated number and may have users visiting the program multiple times. Moreover, we do not have figures from the government  or the private sector on their usage under their programs. Through these efforts, we have provided essential information, guidance  and support to TB patients and their families, empowering them to effectively manage TB and overcome associated challenges.
Additionally, our unique survivor-led approach has resonated with our target audience, fostering trust and credibility within the communities we serve. We have received positive feedback and testimonials from participants, indicating the impact and effectiveness of our program in addressing their needs and concerns related to TB.
As we continue to grow, we aim to expand our reach and impact by scaling our program in different languages (adapting and expanding to 10) and formats to reach more communities and individuals in need by covering a larger set of issues. By leveraging our existing experience, infrastructure, partnerships, and resources, we are poised for further growth and are committed to making a meaningful difference in the fight against TB.
Our focus on scalability, sustainability, and impact measurement ensures that we can effectively drive positive change in TB-affected communities.
 Why are you applying to Solve?: We are relatively new in expanding the program and it's still in its early stages of development and expansion to the next phase. While we have extensive experience in working with communities and stakeholders  and capacity to deliver, we need support, strategic advice, guidance on technology and funding for expanding the program and making it more broad based, inclusive and targeted. We also need support to strategize and establish the necessary infrastructure to  fully realize this solution's potential in the South Asia region and perhaps consider new geographies as well. Here the MIT Solve team and the faculty at MIT would be particularly helpful. This is especially important as in high TB-burden, low and income economies the focus on care paradigms which focus on patient support are limited. 
We are already establishing collaborations with the public sector and also private sector stakeholders. However, working with governments and the private sector also needs considerable  strategic thinking and planning and we would appreciate inputs on this. This support will allow us to expand the reach of this solution with partners in other countries as well with similar disease burden and or linguistic and cultural similarities. They can take this solution to the affected communities and amplify its reach while also providing guidance on the best practices with patients.
We also need to support the technical solution to ideate with MIT faculty in both technology and also behavior change and create the best solution possible for affected communities that remain at risk of lack of support, information and self-care. 
Our goal is to eventually expand this solution to high burden countries elsewhere and hence we are also keen on learning from organizations that have successfully expanded across multiple countries, particularly in terms of managing diverse teams operating in various linguistic contexts.
We also recognize the importance of establishing a robust board of advisors and partners and a proficient fundraising team to propel our initiatives forward. Assistance in this endeavor would greatly contribute to our ability to develop and finance our strategic plans effectively.
Finally, attaining recognition as a Solver would significantly bolster our credibility and facilitate connections with potential partners on a global scale. We believe this affiliation would be instrumental in advancing our mission.
 In which of the following areas do you most need partners or support?: Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Legal or Regulatory Matters, Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)

By doing so, we address systemic gaps and promote personalized, culturally relevant health information and support, with the aim to improve treatment adherence, reduce stigma, and mitigate MH challenges associated with TB.
Unlike traditional top-down approaches, our solution embraces a community- and person-centered design approach, actively involving TB-affected individuals in the design and delivery of support. This is a community led and represented initiative, where communities share stories, motivate and guide through audio visual and textual aids. By prioritizing community voices and preferences, we ensure that TB support and care paradigms are tailored to create a community connect and meet unique needs and cultural contexts, resulting in effective support that enhances patient  responsiveness  and treatment adherence.
Additionally, our solution addresses economic barriers to support and information  by democratizing access to high-quality support and information in the local language with visual aids regardless of economic status or literacy. Leveraging technology to overcome geographical barriers, we promote healthcare access for remote and underserved populations anywhere they may be and  build their capacity to manage their care.
Our solution is not just a simple and easy innovation but one that harnesses the power of universal technology access and combines it with the inputs and lived experiences of community engagement to transform the TB care experience for all irrespective economic, linguistic, geographical, or cultural barriers.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: Our theory of change revolves around the notion that by providing comprehensive, community-designed, and multilingual psychosocial support to TB-affected individuals, we can catalyze positive shifts in mental health outcomes and treatment adherence.
Drawing upon principles from the community action model (Freire, 1974), and the behavior change wheel (Michie et al, 2014), our solution aims to address the root causes of poor TB care paradigms such as lack of patient support, misinformation and associated challenges of stigma, MH and limited community involvement.
 Our theory of change is premised on the following: 
1) Through engagement with our WhatsApp chatbot and utilization of online resources, TB-affected individuals gain access to reliable information, guidance, and support tailored to their specific needs and challenges.
2) Through our community-designed support program, which includes self-guided activities and interactive modules, TB affected individuals develop coping skills, reduce self-stigma and manage their mental health. 
3) The outcome of these two interventions will be that TB affected individuals will be informed,  and feel empowered to actively manage their TB care journey effectively.
Our  strategy emphasizes participatory methods and design thinking to ensure the program's relevance and effectiveness within diverse TB-affected communities.  Our TOC is premised on the participative model as collaboration with TB clinical experts, communication specialists, and healthcare providers further enhances the program's impact and scalability. Leveraging mobile technology and digital health platforms, we aim to facilitate accessible, real time patient support and guidance, ultimately redefining care approaches and driving positive outcomes in the fight against TB. 
Outputs consist of the development of a WhatsApp chatbot and online resources providing reliable information and support, complemented by the creation of a comprehensive program featuring self-guided activities. 
Immediate outcomes entail increased engagement with the chatbot and utilization of resources, leading to decreased self-stigma among TB-affected individuals. Over the long term, we anticipate improved mental health and treatment adherence, driven by enhanced self-efficacy and agency in managing TB care.

84251,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Using Mobile-App and Telemedicine to Address Common Mental Health Issues Related to Climate Change ,Rwanda ,Rwanda,"Other, including part of a larger organization (please explain below)","<p>The School of Public Health, in the College of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Rwanda, serves as a teaching institution engaged in cutting-edge research and community support. The school undertakes numerous projects aimed at assisting marginalized populations affected by climate change. Among the challenges faced by these populations are common mental health problems such as depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders. These issues disproportionately affect women and marginalized people, who often face difficulties in mobility and are stigmatized due to the problems they experience. Consequently, the organization is well-equipped to undertake innovative work in this area.
</p>","<p>In Rwanda, the prevalence of depression among adults in communities affected by climate change is estimated to be around 32.9%, while the prevalence of anxiety is approximately 38.4%, and post-traumatic stress disorder affects about 19.3% of the population. These rates are higher than the global averages for these mental health disorders. Globally, climate change is expected to increase the prevalence of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety, and it estimated that millions of people worldwide will be affected by these disorders due to climate change-related factors, including extreme weather events, food insecurity, and displacement, all of which can contribute to the development of mental health problems. Moreover, the lack of access to mental health services for adults in Rwanda’s climate-affected communities is a significant issue. Globally, around 75% of people with mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in low-income countries do not receive the treatment they need. This lack of access can lead to prolonged suffering and decreased resilience in the face of ongoing climate-related challenges, highlighting the urgent need for interventions that can provide accessible and effective mental health support.</p>
<p>Our intervention proposes the use of mobile-app technology and telemedicine to bridge this gap in mental health care. By leveraging the widespread use of mobile phones in Rwanda, especially in rural areas, we aim to provide accessible and effective mental health support to adults experiencing common mental health issues related to climate change. The mobile app will serve as a platform for delivering psychoeducation, self-help tools, and guided self-help interventions for mental health issues. Additionally, our intervention will utilize telemedicine to connect individuals with mental health professionals remotely. Through video conferencing and teleconsultation, individuals will be able to receive assessment, diagnosis, and treatment from trained professionals without the need to travel long distances to access care. This approach not only improves access to mental health services but also reduces the stigma associated with seeking help for mental health issues.
  </p>
<p>Therefore, our intervention seeks to address the specific problem of limited access to mental health services for adults in communities affected by climate change in Rwanda.

 Provide a one-line summary of your solution.: Using Mobile-App and Telemedicine to Address Common Mental Health Issues Related to Climate Change 
 In what city, town, or region is your solution team headquartered?: Rwanda 
 In what country is your solution team headquartered?: Rwanda
 What type of organization is your solution team?: Other, including part of a larger organization (please explain below)
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: The School of Public Health, in the College of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Rwanda, serves as a teaching institution engaged in cutting-edge research and community support. The school undertakes numerous projects aimed at assisting marginalized populations affected by climate change. Among the challenges faced by these populations are common mental health problems such as depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders. These issues disproportionately affect women and marginalized people, who often face difficulties in mobility and are stigmatized due to the problems they experience. Consequently, the organization is well-equipped to undertake innovative work in this area.

 What specific problem are you solving?: In Rwanda, the prevalence of depression among adults in communities affected by climate change is estimated to be around 32.9%, while the prevalence of anxiety is approximately 38.4%, and post-traumatic stress disorder affects about 19.3% of the population. These rates are higher than the global averages for these mental health disorders. Globally, climate change is expected to increase the prevalence of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety, and it estimated that millions of people worldwide will be affected by these disorders due to climate change-related factors, including extreme weather events, food insecurity, and displacement, all of which can contribute to the development of mental health problems. Moreover, the lack of access to mental health services for adults in Rwanda’s climate-affected communities is a significant issue. Globally, around 75% of people with mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in low-income countries do not receive the treatment they need. This lack of access can lead to prolonged suffering and decreased resilience in the face of ongoing climate-related challenges, highlighting the urgent need for interventions that can provide accessible and effective mental health support.
Our intervention proposes the use of mobile-app technology and telemedicine to bridge this gap in mental health care. By leveraging the widespread use of mobile phones in Rwanda, especially in rural areas, we aim to provide accessible and effective mental health support to adults experiencing common mental health issues related to climate change. The mobile app will serve as a platform for delivering psychoeducation, self-help tools, and guided self-help interventions for mental health issues. Additionally, our intervention will utilize telemedicine to connect individuals with mental health professionals remotely. Through video conferencing and teleconsultation, individuals will be able to receive assessment, diagnosis, and treatment from trained professionals without the need to travel long distances to access care. This approach not only improves access to mental health services but also reduces the stigma associated with seeking help for mental health issues.
  
Therefore, our intervention seeks to address the specific problem of limited access to mental health services for adults in communities affected by climate change in Rwanda. By leveraging mobile-app technology and telemedicine, we aim to provide accessible, effective, and stigma-free mental health support to improve the well-being and resilience of individuals facing the mental health impacts of climate change.

The mobile app is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible to a wide range of individuals, including those with limited access to healthcare. It utilizes a symptom checker that is more sensitive, although less specific, for early detection of mental health issues. This means it can accurately identify a broader range of potential mental health problems, helping to catch issues early.
Once a potential mental health issue is identified, the app connects the user with telemedicine services. Telemedicine allows for remote consultation with healthcare professionals, including psychiatrists and psychologists, who can verify the diagnosis and provide tailored treatment plans. This approach increases specificity in diagnosis and ensures that individuals receive appropriate care for their specific mental health needs. Additionally, our solution includes psychosocial support for individuals affected by climate challenges. This support can help individuals cope with the psychological impacts of climate change, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. By addressing both the mental health and psychosocial needs of individuals, our solution aims to reduce the burden of mental illness and improve overall well-being.
  
The technologies used in our solution are readily available and widely used, making them accessible to the target population. The mobile app can be downloaded onto smartphones, which are increasingly prevalent even in rural areas of Rwanda. Telemedicine services can be accessed through the app, allowing individuals to connect with healthcare professionals from the comfort of their own homes. One of the key advantages of our solution is its ability to reach marginalized populations, including women, people in poverty, minorities, people with disabilities, and those facing stigma. These populations often have limited access to healthcare services, making them more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on mental health. By providing a user-friendly mobile app and telemedicine services, our solution aims to bridge this gap and ensure that everyone has access to quality mental health care.
  

  In conclusion, our solution offers a practical and accessible way to address the mental health challenges faced by adults affected by climate change in Rwanda. By combining a simple mobile app with telemedicine services and psychosocial support, we aim to reduce the burden of mental illness and improve the overall well-being of individuals in this population. Our hope is that this solution can be replicated in other populations facing similar challenges, providing much-needed mental health support to those who need it most.

Importantly, our organization director, who spearheads this initiative, is not only deeply passionate about improving the lives of the residents but also shares a personal connection as a person with a disability. This personal connection fosters trust and understanding within the community, as they see us not just as outsiders but as individuals who empathize with their challenges and are dedicated to addressing them.</p>
<p>Our track record further solidifies the community's trust in us. Just two months ago, we undertook a significant initiative to distribute over 1000 crutches to the residents of Karonmajigi. This act of tangible support not only met an immediate need but also demonstrated our ongoing commitment to enhancing the lives of persons with disabilities in the community. Through such actions, we have established ourselves as reliable partners who prioritize the needs and well-being of Karonmajigi's residents above all else.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have strategically involved key community members in our team to ensure that our efforts are well-aligned with the community's needs and aspirations. One such vital member is the community elder, who holds significant influence and respect within Karonmajigi. Their involvement not only provides invaluable insight into the community's dynamics and challenges but also helps us navigate and access more demographic parts of Karonmajigi effectively. With the community elder's guidance and support, we can ensure that our interventions are inclusive, culturally sensitive, and responsive to the diverse needs of all residents.</p>
<p>In summary, our team's local presence, personal connections, demonstrated commitment, and strategic partnerships uniquely position us to execute this solution in Karonmajigi successfully. By leveraging these strengths, we can overcome barriers, build trust, and effectively deliver essential healthcare services to the underserved disability community, ultimately improving their health outcomes and quality of life.</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","3.

Social and cultural inequalities shape our lives and influence our ability to access key resources such as education, livelihoods, and justice. Access to healthcare is no exception. For instance, as per<a href=""https://thewire.in/health/one-in-4-indians-face-discrimination-while-accessing-healthcare-due-to-caste-religion-oxfam""> the Oxfam India report of 2021</a>, one in 4 Indians faces discrimination while accessing healthcare in India based on their religion and caste. This discrimination manifests in various forms, including denial of patient records, case papers or investigative reports. According to this report, 74 % of respondents mentioned that their doctors prescribed treatment, further tests and/or medication without fully explaining their illness, nature and/or its cause. There also exists <a href=""https://www.re-solveglobalhealth.com/post/how-caste-is-a-major-barrier-to-health-equity-in-india"">anecdotal evidence</a> of the discrimination that the Dalit and Tribal communities face while accessing healthcare. The overall poor health outcomes amongst them are a direct result of the discrimination and stigma that they face while accessing healthcare in India.</p>
<p>Similarly, despite recent legal reforms in India, the LGBTQIA+ community, which constitutes <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/alcoholabuse/years-after-decriminalization-of-homosexuality-inclusivity-is-still-a-dream-for-the-lgbtq-community-50482/"">around 10% of the Indian population</a> (around 135 million people), continues to <a href=""https://thewire.in/health/indias-healthcare-systems-persistently-exclude-lgbtq-people-this-needs-to-change"">face systemic exclusion from healthcare</a>. Discrimination against them <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26410397.2022.2104678"">manifests in various forms</a>, including but not limited to judgment at the hospital entrance gate, refusal of treatment, lack of understanding about sex- and gender-related diseases, and labelling non-heterosexual sexual orientation as a psychological disorder. Furthermore, weight bias and fat shaming are rampant within healthcare, which influences fat people’s healthcare services-seeking behaviour. Anecdotal evidence shows the bias that fat people face when visiting a doctor in various ways, from <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63699428"">attributing all kinds of illnesses to being fat </a>to <a href=""https://www.theswaddle.com/body-matters-fatphobia-in-a-gynaecs-office"">refusal of treatment if the patient in question does not lose weight to dismissal of concerns due to fatphobia</a>. Such experiences make people apprehensive of visiting doctors, putting them at an increased risk for illnesses.</p>
<p>These examples show that people with different intersectional identities face discrimination while accessing healthcare, which further influences their healthcare-seeking behaviour leading to detrimental health-related outcomes. While such instances of discrimination and bias are highly common, there are laws to prevent such discrimination and redressal mechanisms to address complaints and concerns. However, <a href=""https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/170413_GrievanceRedressalMechanisms.pdf"">information that facilitates a patient’s ability to advocate for themselves and hold healthcare systems accountable remains sparsely available</a>.

When a user tries to interact with this chatbot, they will be presented with 3 options: ‘I want information on legal rights’, ‘I want to information on how to file a complaint’ and ‘I am not sure’. After selecting one of the options, the user will be prompted to describe the situation and ask questions. At the backend, the team has developed a comprehensive database that includes relevant information within healthcare and updated information on hyperlocal legal support that will enable the bot to provide the information as requested.

 Provide a one-line summary of your solution.: Enabling individuals to tackle healthcare discrimination through legal knowledge and support for navigating and advocating within the system.
 In what city, town, or region is your solution team headquartered?: Mumbai, Maharashtra, India
 In what country is your solution team headquartered?: India
 What type of organization is your solution team?: Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: nan
 What specific problem are you solving?: We are seeking to solve the problem of inequitable access to healthcare. Social and cultural inequalities shape our lives and influence our ability to access key resources such as education, livelihoods, and justice. Access to healthcare is no exception. For instance, as per the Oxfam India report of 2021, one in 4 Indians faces discrimination while accessing healthcare in India based on their religion and caste. This discrimination manifests in various forms, including denial of patient records, case papers or investigative reports. According to this report, 74 % of respondents mentioned that their doctors prescribed treatment, further tests and/or medication without fully explaining their illness, nature and/or its cause. There also exists anecdotal evidence of the discrimination that the Dalit and Tribal communities face while accessing healthcare. The overall poor health outcomes amongst them are a direct result of the discrimination and stigma that they face while accessing healthcare in India.
Similarly, despite recent legal reforms in India, the LGBTQIA+ community, which constitutes around 10% of the Indian population (around 135 million people), continues to face systemic exclusion from healthcare. Discrimination against them manifests in various forms, including but not limited to judgment at the hospital entrance gate, refusal of treatment, lack of understanding about sex- and gender-related diseases, and labelling non-heterosexual sexual orientation as a psychological disorder. Furthermore, weight bias and fat shaming are rampant within healthcare, which influences fat people’s healthcare services-seeking behaviour. Anecdotal evidence shows the bias that fat people face when visiting a doctor in various ways, from attributing all kinds of illnesses to being fat to refusal of treatment if the patient in question does not lose weight to dismissal of concerns due to fatphobia. Such experiences make people apprehensive of visiting doctors, putting them at an increased risk for illnesses.
These examples show that people with different intersectional identities face discrimination while accessing healthcare, which further influences their healthcare-seeking behaviour leading to detrimental health-related outcomes. While such instances of discrimination and bias are highly common, there are laws to prevent such discrimination and redressal mechanisms to address complaints and concerns. However, information that facilitates a patient’s ability to advocate for themselves and hold healthcare systems accountable remains sparsely available. Patient advocacy can ensure not only that patients have access to quality healthcare but also that healthcare providers are accountable for their actions. Hence, through this project, we aim to address a critical gap in the field and build a solution that equips individuals with the information required to advocate for themselves.
 What is your solution?: Our solution is named Sahayak, a healthcare advocacy chatbot designed to strengthen patient rights within the healthcare system by providing them access to information about their substantive and procedural rights as well as by providing them guidance on negotiating with and advocating for their rights within the healthcare system. This chatbot uses the API from Jugalbandi, an open platform combining the power of Generative AI and Indian language translation models to power conversational AI solutions. When a user tries to interact with this chatbot, they will be presented with 3 options: ‘I want information on legal rights’, ‘I want to information on how to file a complaint’ and ‘I am not sure’. After selecting one of the options, the user will be prompted to describe the situation and ask questions. At the backend, the team has developed a comprehensive database that includes relevant information within healthcare and updated information on hyperlocal legal support that will enable the bot to provide the information as requested. The chatbot does not provide any medical advice to patients. It is designed to offer information, support, and guidance related to healthcare advocacy and patients' rights, but it does not replace professional medical advice or diagnosis.
Further, the chatbot operates in an advisory capacity only. The advice provided should not be considered binding legal advice or a substitute for professional legal counsel. Users will be encouraged to seek personalised legal advice for specific situations. This chatbot does not track any actions taken by the user after obtaining information, and it is meant to equip users with the required knowledge and information to advocate for themselves. However, there will be an in-built feedback mechanism to capture the feedback from the users on the obtained information.
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : The target audience for the first iteration of the chatbot includes individuals in the age group of 18-45 years. We recognise the limitations of building a tech-based solution that requires users to have access to a smartphone and proficiency in certain languages. Thus, we are targeting individuals residing in urban and semi-urban areas, focusing on marginalised communities who may face socio-cultural discrimination within the healthcare system. Currently, the chatbot functions in two key languages - English and Hindi. However, we hope to incorporate additional languages in future iterations. Since the information on grievance redressal and patient advocacy is sparsely available, we believe a chatbot that can offer hyperlocal information on negotiating and advocating within the healthcare system and strategies to assert their rights will enable individuals to advocate for themselves. The chatbot provides hyperlocal information for healthcare establishments in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai. We will expand the database to incorporate other cities as we progress with the development.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: We are a team of young women and queer folks who have faced differential treatment from healthcare professionals due to gender, disability and fatness. Our lived experiences, along with anecdotal experiences shared by the community, inform this solution. As an organisation, we work with women and queer folks across our projects and are well-versed in the challenges that they face while accessing healthcare. Within the community, individuals often reach out for requests for inclusive, non-judgemental healthcare providers, given their negative experiences. Further, we are undertaking a research study on Fatness in Urban India, which has also reaffirmed the bias and challenges that fat people face while consulting healthcare providers due to their body size, shape and weight.

 What makes your solution innovative?: Existing chatbots focus increasingly on providing patients with access to information about their diagnosis, inputs into managing symptoms, and/or insight into behaviour changes required to better one’s health. However, there are limited solutions that focus on equipping individuals with relevant information to advocate for themselves within the healthcare system. Our solution, Sahayak, offers not only legal information on patient rights but also hyperlocal information on asserting these rights.

The target audience for Sahayak is individuals aged 18-45 residing in urban and semi-urban areas, with the chatbot currently supporting English and Hindi languages.

The team is composed of young women and queer individuals with direct experiences of differential treatment in healthcare. Their experience is complemented by previous projects providing legal aid and forming the foundation for Sahayak's development. The solution aims to increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups, addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

Sahayak's business model intends to keep the chatbot free for users, aiming for partnerships with healthcare institutions to integrate the service into existing patient support mechanisms. Financial sustainability plans involve applying for grants, crowdfunding, and institutional funding. The long-term goal includes reaching 5,000 people in the first year of deployment and building an open-source community around Sahayak to attract further funding.

Africa accounts for 95% of all malaria cases and deaths, with the remainder of cases occurring in India (2% of the global burden) and in various countries in South America and Asia. Malaria is the number one cause of death and disease in many developing countries, where pregnant women and children under the age of five are the groups most affected. In addition, it is responsible for the loss of millions of workdays and school days. It <a href=""https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8XP7BSD"">has been estimated</a> that malaria severely impedes economic development, to the extent that countries affected by malaria have a per capita income only 30% as high as non-affected countries.</p>
<p>Currently, the most common methods for fighting malaria are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), both of which have significantly decreased malaria cases in the last few decades, but whose effectiveness has been dwindling due to mosquito adaptation to <a href=""https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-020-04170-7"">outdoor biting </a>and their <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2006781117"">growing resistance to the insecticides</a> used in these methods, as well as <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X21002163"">limited uptake and compliance</a> and other reasons. 
  </p>
<p>Decades ago, <a href=""https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=0b2af47f4feb51b5f72214fa43a44c13f722d90f"">many countries eliminated it</a> using an environmentally benign method known as larviciding, namely, treating the water bodies in which mosquitos breed. However, in order to achieve malaria eradication, it is necessary to find and treat a very high percentage of the millions of water bodies (in many cases, puddles) around people's houses. <a href=""https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-8-311"">Studies have shown</a> that even experienced fieldworkers miss about 40% of the water bodies in the areas they are assigned to search. </p>
<p><a href=""https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-023-04543-0"">Digital tools</a> have significantly enhanced the cost-effectiveness of larviciding operations in urban and semi-urban areas, streamlining the identification and treatment of mosquito breeding sites. However, in rural areas, the scenario is markedly different. The challenges here are compounded by the vast distances between remote communities and operational centers, leading to increased costs related to transportation and the additional working hours field workers spend in transit. While <a href=""https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-023-04713-0"">drones</a> have demonstrated potential in improving coverage and detection of breeding sites, they cannot always be applied effectively in these settings and, by themselves, do not constitute a comprehensive solution. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a tailored solution that addresses the unique challenges faced by rural communities. These areas are in particularly acute need of such interventions, as they carry the main burden of malaria, suffering higher incidence rates and facing more significant obstacles in accessing healthcare and preventive services.</p>","<p>Our solution is a comprehensive initiative designed to empower women in rural areas for effective malaria control through community-based larviciding, leveraging a designated mobile app. This project will train women to utilize the app for identifying and treating mosquito breeding sites, deploying traps and monitoring results. It will harness the pivotal role women play in their communities, particularly in healthcare, by equipping them with the digital tools and skills necessary for sustainable, eco-friendly mosquito control.</p>
<p>The methodology will involve recruiting capable women from the community, providing them with smartphones, and offering condensed training. This training will cover understanding malaria transmission, mosquito breeding habits and the use of WHO-approved larvicides. The app, central to our solution, will employ GPS technology for tracking and reporting larviciding activities and mosquito population data. This information will be uploaded to an online dashboard for remote monitoring by project managers, facilitating real-time support and assessment of the initiative's effectiveness.</p>
<p>By focusing on water bodies as potential breeding sites, women will apply larvicides, cover or dry these areas as needed, incorporating domestic mosquito control advocacy within their communities. Compensation for their work will be based on hours recorded by the app, with additional bonuses for achieving benchmarks in mosquito and malaria reduction. This approach will not only address public health concerns but also promote socio-economic development and empowerment of women in these communities.</p>
<p>Moreover, the project will emphasize gender equality and human rights, ensuring the safety and well-being of participants throughout. It will include pre-training gender assessments, secure training environments, selection of communities with consideration for women's safety and provision of appropriate safety gear for field activities. This initiative is about empowering women with digital skills and tools for malaria control, fostering their economic growth, personal development, and enhancing their roles in healthcare and community leadership.</p>","<p>Malaria is almost exclusively a disease of the underprivileged. To begin with, it affects developing countries, almost all of which in Africa, and many of which with a large proportion of the population living in <a href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY"">extreme poverty</a> (i.e., on less than $1.90 per day). Within these countries, rural communities bear the brunt of malaria, with vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by the disease: children under the age of 5, pregnant women and–<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3767/#:~:text=Malaria%2C%20more%20than%20any%20other,20%25%20of%20the%20world's%20population."">more than any other significant health issue–impoverished people</a>. Not surprisingly, malaria is profoundly underfunded. According to the WHO, the annual resources needed in order to reach its malaria control milestones for 2025 were estimated at $6.8 billion in 2020. However, the actual funding was a mere $3.5 billion, and the funding gap is ever growing. Based on a <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30165-3/fulltext""><em>Lancet </em>article from 2016</a>, the average expenditure of an African country on controlling malaria was $3 PPP. <br /></p>
<p>The flipside of this grim situation is that even incremental improvements result in multiple lives saved. Indeed, contributing to malaria prevention efforts results in one of the most lives saved <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities"">per dollar donated</a>. Our solution, which, as mentioned, has been shown to be twice as cost-effective as today's leading anti-malaria intervention, thus holds the potential of <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zsLcixRzqr64CacfK/zzappmalaria-twice-as-cost-effective-as-bed-nets-in-urban"">saving more than 140,000 lives annually</a> even with existing funding. 
  The benefits of fighting malaria extend beyond saving lives, since they also contribute to the improvement of education and economic conditions. When children suffer from malaria, they often miss school days, which hinders their educational progress (this is particularly true for girls, who are often required to stay home to take care of sick family members). By reducing the incidence of malaria, children can attend school more consistently and concentrate better in class, ultimately leading to better educational outcomes. In addition, the economic situation of affected communities improves as healthier individuals can work more efficiently, boosting productivity and overall economic growth. Furthermore, in the case of digitally managed field operations to combat malaria, there are additional benefits to the community. Not only do these operations support local labor, but they also promote the acquisition of digital skills. The use of modern technology in these operations helps empower local communities, fostering self-reliance and resilience, while simultaneously providing valuable tools and resources to improve the overall effectiveness of malaria prevention initiatives.</p>","<p>Zzapp was founded in 2016 by Arnon Houri-Yafin after he spent three months in hospitals in India conducting research on a malaria blood test. Witnessing the devastating impact of the disease, Arnon decided to use technology not only to diagnose malaria but to eradicate it. Zzapp team members are highly skilled professionals that are deeply committed to the cause and possess years of field experience. Zzapp’s team members hold advanced degrees, including two PhDs, from prestigious universities such as the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, Georgetown University and the Hebrew University. With a wealth of experience in diverse fields ranging from operation management and data analysis to software development and community engagement, our team has received numerous academic excellence awards and grants. Several team members have either contracted malaria themselves or lost siblings to the illness.<br /></p>
<p>Despite our extensive professional and personal experience, we acknowledge that effective and sustainable solutions require a community-driven approach. We therefore continuously gather feedback through formal and informal methods. Feedback collection, led by our implementation expert, Alexandra Wharton-Smith, starts during the 3-day training that we offer fieldworkers. Based on our experiences in these sessions, we have enhanced our system, guidance materials, and teaching methods. During operations, we encourage managers and fieldworkers to share comments and suggestions via a designated WhatsApp group. We also actively seek their input during field visits, casual conversations, and structured interviews and focus groups. Overall, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both managers and workers. They have reported finding the app useful and even fun (similar to a scavenger hunt or a game of Pokémon GO…). In some instances, workers voluntarily continued working after hours to complete their assigned ""chunks,"" even after being assured that it was not expected of them. Many workers also uploaded photos of themselves standing next to water bodies they had identified, demonstrating a clear sense of pride in their accomplishments.
  </p>
<p>These are a few of the reviews that we received:
  </p>
<p>“Despite the technology’s sophistication, the app and the dashboard are very intuitive and user-friendly. In an operation in the Amhara region in 2019, we located all the water bodies, which is usually a great challenge. Fundamentally, the technology helped us in saving time and energy. It also helped us in prioritizing severely affected villages.” (Dr. Abebe Asale, the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology [ICIPE], Ethiopia, 2019
   ""The app has come at the right time. The app comes in handy in terms of helping us map all the municipality and also find the breeding sites for treatment."" (Kwame Desewu, entomologist, AngloGold Ashanti Malaria Control[AGAMal], Ghana, 2017).</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","1.

Sustainable Cities and Communities",Scale,"<p>We have a field-tested, fully functioning system – in the development of which more than $1M has been invested – whose core principle is applying local data, micro planning and thorough management on a nation-level scale. We continue to improve our tools, refine our working protocols and deepen our entomological, epidemiological and operational knowledge,  As determined by an external consultant for scalability, we are well prepared to scale up to protect hundreds of districts and towns with a population of hundreds of millions across Africa, thanks to several factors: the atomization our system facilitates; the outstanding results we have already achieved; the highly competitive price we offer; our strong ties with research institutions, implementing partners and governments; and high market demand. </p>
<p>Our forthcoming solution, a women-led larviciding initiative guided by our existing digital app, represents a critical innovation that will enable the scaling of our efforts to rural areas, unlocking the full potential of larviciding in combating malaria on a national level. <br /></p>","<p>As a Business-to-Government (B2G) company, we work with governments, but also with donors, NGOs, and policymakers, including the WHO.

We believe that Solve can help us surmount these challenges by facilitating vital partnerships to accelerate our efforts, validate our business model's impact and sustainability, and ultimately broaden our solution's reach to more communities in need. In addition to addressing these technical and market barriers, we seek networking opportunities to assist in completing a funding round. We have secured a term sheet from an investor (who is actually <em>not </em>an impact investor), contingent on the involvement of another VC in the round. We are confident that Solve can aid in identifying and connecting us with a suitable investor (VC or angel) to participate in our funding round and further advance our mission.</p>","Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media)",Arnon Houri-Yafin ,No,No,,"Yes, this solution is already (or has been in the past) a part of other networks",<p>Google for Startups </p>,"No, I didn’t take the course",Email from your network,<p>We applied last year and did not make it to the final stages. We decided to reapply this year. </p>,"<p>Our solution is distinguished in the battle against malaria by its integration of approach, functionality and technology, underpinned by a strong emphasis on community-driven efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong> Moving beyond the prevalent reliance on insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying, our strategy focuses on community-led larviciding at outdoor water sources. This method draws on the successes of historical eradication campaigns. By mobilizing community members, in these initiatives, we leverage local knowledge and commitment, significantly boosting the impact and durability of our efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: Traditional larviciding operations often face challenges with efficient management, which our solution overcomes through the strategic use of mobile technology. Our app facilitates precise coordination of treatment areas and real-time progress monitoring, ensuring comprehensive coverage and the collection of dependable data. The engagement of community members, guided by our technology, ensures an organized and effective approach, markedly improving operational performance.</p>
<p><strong>Technology: </strong>Our system employs cutting-edge neural networks to analyze satellite imagery for accurate mapping of dwellings, then scrutinizes various satellite data to identify areas suitable for mosquito breeding. Armed with this data and an optimization algorithm, we meticulously plan larviciding activities, delegating manageable tasks to community-based teams. Additionally, our spatial-agent-based malaria simulator fine-tunes intervention strategies, enabling each action to achieve maximum efficacy. This technological sophistication supports community operatives, enabling them to make informed decisions, even without internet access and maintain momentum and data accuracy.</p>
<p>By centering our efforts on community involvement, our solution not only innovates in malaria prevention but also empowers local populations, providing valuable skills and job opportunities while tackling a major health issue. This community-centric approach seeks not just to significantly cut down malaria transmission but also to foster broader positive changes, advocating for community empowerment and collective action in public health endeavors. Our model aims to revolutionize the market landscape, showcasing the power of community-led, technologically empowered health interventions on a broad scale.</p>","<p><strong>Goal </strong></p>

<p>2. Increased Community Engagement: Community members actively participate in malaria prevention efforts.</p>
<p>3. Improved Health Outcomes: A reduction in malaria incidence as community members adopt preventive behaviors and benefit from a decreased mosquito population.</p>
<p><strong>Final Outcome</strong></p>
<p>A sustainable reduction in malaria cases by 50%+ in the targeted rural areas, demonstrating that the technology and community-led approach can be scaled nationally with cost-effectiveness significantly better than existing solutions. </p>","<p>Our primary impact goal is to significantly reduce malaria incidence in rural areas by at least 50% on average, at a cost of less than $0.45 per person protected, demonstrating our solution's scalability and cost-effectiveness. This target reflects our commitment to transforming lives through innovative malaria control strategies, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.3 to end the malaria epidemic by 2030. We aim to showcase our technology's potential for national-level application at a cost-effectiveness that doubles that of today's leading solutions. Moreover, our approach is poised to unlock the potential for nationwide malaria elimination at the average expenditure an African country currently allocates to merely control the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring progress towards impact goals</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Malaria Incidence Reduction: We rely on official data regarding malaria incidence per 1,000 population, aligning with the UN's indicator for SDG 3.3. This allows us to directly measure our impact on reducing malaria cases in the communities we serve.</p>
<p>2. Mosquito Population Control: Through before, during and after comparisons of mosquito trap catches, we assess the effectiveness of our larviciding operations in reducing the adult mosquito population.</p>
<p>3. Mosquito Larvae Reduction: By comparing water body sampling results from mosquito breeding sites, we gauge the success of our interventions in diminishing mosquito larvae populations.</p>
<p>4. Cost-Effectiveness: The cost per person protected is a critical metric for us, ensuring our solution remains affordable and scalable. Achieving our goal of less than $0.45 per person underscores the financial viability and broader applicability of our approach.</p>","<p>The core of our technology comprises an AI planning tool, a spatial-agent-based mosquito simulator, a mobile app and an online dashboard. First, our AI component extracts from satellite images the location of houses and demarcates the general area for the intervention. Then, integrating data on climate, topography and land use, it runs numerous scenarios in the simulator. Based on predicted effectiveness outcomes, it selects the specific strategy for each village, recommending where to scan for water bodies, which houses to spray, where to place mosquito traps and what implementation order to employ. The system assists with implementing the selected strategy using a GPS-based mobile app that allocates treatment areas to workers, monitors their location in the field to ensure they cover the entire area, and tracks schedules for water body treatment and other tasks. The app was designed to work in Africa’s field conditions: it has a low battery consumption, works well even on simple smartphones and can operate offline. Information from the fieldworkers, as well as that which has been obtained from drones, is automatically uploaded to the dashboard, allowing managers to monitor the operation in real time. The dashboard also produces issue-specific reports – for example, fieldworkers’ productivity or the correlation between water body type and positivity – that improve monitoring of the operation and facilitate post-operation analysis and lesson learning.</p>",A new application of an existing technology,,"Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, Big Data, GIS and Geospatial Technology, Software and Mobile Applications",zzappmalaria.com,"Djibouti,Ghana","Kenya,Mozambique,Zambia","<p>Full time: 7 </p>

It generates multiple perspectives on issues and fosters the development of creative solutions. Moreover, the ability to understand and empathize with others enables better addressing of the needs of customers from various cultural backgrounds. And, simply, it helps everyone feel comfortable with who they are. As a company operating in diverse cultural settings, with solutions that significantly benefit from community engagement, it is only natural that our team reflects the advantages of diversity. Our team members represent diverse genders, sexual orientations, religions, religious observances and nationalities. In this context, adopting a gender lens when addressing malaria is particularly important. Women are not only disproportionately affected by malaria (e.g., they face higher risks of mortality during pregnancy and often care for sick family members), but they also play a crucial role in malaria control efforts. Women make up 70% of the community health worker force and are instrumental in adopting malaria control practices. These practices range from ensuring that their children receive seasonal preventive medications and use bed nets, to seeking medical care at healthcare facilities when their children fall ill. It <a href=""https://chemonics.com/blog/beyond-bed-nets-how-gender-integration-can-improve-malaria-control/"">has been shown</a> that gender integration improves malaria control. Acknowledging the importance of this perspective, we took part in writing the Gender &amp; Malaria Community of Practice Advocacy Agenda (“Eradication Through Equity: An Advocacy Agenda for a Gender Transformative Approach to the Fight Against Malaria”). We also apply a hiring policy in which if one of two equally competent candidates is a woman, she will receive the position. Indeed, women have been holding leading positions in Zzapp with regards to AI, policy and operations. Gender equality extends beyond hiring and staffing; it also involves creating supportive working conditions. For example, when our employee once had a work-related trip to a field operation in West Africa, Zzapp covered the full costs of flights and accommodations for the baby and her nanny.<br /></p>","<p>Our business model focuses on providing value to the populations we serve in terms of impact and revenue through comprehensive anti-malaria vector control and surveillance services. We tailor our solutions to each location's specific needs and budgets, offering services at a competitive cost while maintaining effectiveness and profitability. </p>
<p>We provide our customers, which include governments, municipalities, local authorities and implementing partners, with products and services that support the implementation of operations ranging from the municipal to the nationwide scale. Besides the software, we offer a wide gamut of services, including training, operational management, quality assurance, monitoring and community engagement. Our resources comprise digital technology, materials and equipment, logistical centers, offices, entomological labs, human resources, data and company know-how.

<p>The gains for citizens in affected countries are immense, as large-scale prevention or elimination of malaria can significantly improve public health, reduce morbidity and mortality and contribute to economic growth. Implementing partners benefit from our AI-generated tailored strategies, automated cost estimation and budgeting, improved management, highly cost-effective outcomes, increased accountability and post-analysis insights, addressing their main pain points in planning, execution and results analysis.

Our primary service, accounting for 95% of revenues until EOY 2026 and 81% of gross profit, is nationwide malaria elimination operations—a unique offering in the market. Additional services include district control for low-burden countries, urban larviciding for comprehensive city water body coverage and future platforms to combat mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika.</p>
<p>Our nationwide malaria elimination operations will typically begin with an eight-month, single-district paid pilot to showcase the effectiveness of our method within the client's local context. The pilot helps us tailor our system and methods to the country's specific ecosystem and society, facilitates government decision-making and bidding processes, and aids in obtaining loans from the World Bank. Following a successful pilot, we plan a three-year, two-stage nationwide campaign: a first-year ""blanket phase"" and a two-year ""targeted phase."" The final cost and structure depend on factors such as area size, population and climate. </p>
<p>Based on our experience and mathematical models, we estimate that a typical 3-year nationwide elimination operation will cost the government an average annual $3.33 PPP, from which we will deliver immediate annual governmental cost savings of $1.67 PPP and major additional long-term cost savings. We will form a joint venture together with a selected implementing partner that will manage the whole sum ($300M in the case of a typical 30M population country), with which we will hire labor and transportation (70% of cost), buy aerial imagery and insecticides, run labs, and cover all the other operation costs. We will actively manage all the operational aspects of the operation. For this service, our gross profit will be $0.43 PPP or $39M (13% of the operation's total 3-year cost; according to service providers with whom we spoke, including companies and NGOs, the typical gross profit of service-givers for World Bank-funded projects is 25% of the project’s total expenditure. We aim for gross profit of between only 7% and 17% depending on the type of service and program complexity working in close concert with profit-sharing local implementation partners).

 What specific problem are you solving?: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2022 malaria posed a threat to nearly half of the world's population, causing sickness to 209 million people and claiming 608,000 lives. Africa accounts for 95% of all malaria cases and deaths, with the remainder of cases occurring in India (2% of the global burden) and in various countries in South America and Asia. Malaria is the number one cause of death and disease in many developing countries, where pregnant women and children under the age of five are the groups most affected. In addition, it is responsible for the loss of millions of workdays and school days. It has been estimated that malaria severely impedes economic development, to the extent that countries affected by malaria have a per capita income only 30% as high as non-affected countries.
Currently, the most common methods for fighting malaria are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), both of which have significantly decreased malaria cases in the last few decades, but whose effectiveness has been dwindling due to mosquito adaptation to outdoor biting and their growing resistance to the insecticides used in these methods, as well as limited uptake and compliance and other reasons. 
  
Decades ago, many countries eliminated it using an environmentally benign method known as larviciding, namely, treating the water bodies in which mosquitos breed. However, in order to achieve malaria eradication, it is necessary to find and treat a very high percentage of the millions of water bodies (in many cases, puddles) around people's houses. Studies have shown that even experienced fieldworkers miss about 40% of the water bodies in the areas they are assigned to search. 
Digital tools have significantly enhanced the cost-effectiveness of larviciding operations in urban and semi-urban areas, streamlining the identification and treatment of mosquito breeding sites. However, in rural areas, the scenario is markedly different. The challenges here are compounded by the vast distances between remote communities and operational centers, leading to increased costs related to transportation and the additional working hours field workers spend in transit. While drones have demonstrated potential in improving coverage and detection of breeding sites, they cannot always be applied effectively in these settings and, by themselves, do not constitute a comprehensive solution. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a tailored solution that addresses the unique challenges faced by rural communities. These areas are in particularly acute need of such interventions, as they carry the main burden of malaria, suffering higher incidence rates and facing more significant obstacles in accessing healthcare and preventive services.
 What is your solution?: Our solution is a comprehensive initiative designed to empower women in rural areas for effective malaria control through community-based larviciding, leveraging a designated mobile app. This project will train women to utilize the app for identifying and treating mosquito breeding sites, deploying traps and monitoring results. It will harness the pivotal role women play in their communities, particularly in healthcare, by equipping them with the digital tools and skills necessary for sustainable, eco-friendly mosquito control.
The methodology will involve recruiting capable women from the community, providing them with smartphones, and offering condensed training. This training will cover understanding malaria transmission, mosquito breeding habits and the use of WHO-approved larvicides. The app, central to our solution, will employ GPS technology for tracking and reporting larviciding activities and mosquito population data. This information will be uploaded to an online dashboard for remote monitoring by project managers, facilitating real-time support and assessment of the initiative's effectiveness.
By focusing on water bodies as potential breeding sites, women will apply larvicides, cover or dry these areas as needed, incorporating domestic mosquito control advocacy within their communities. Compensation for their work will be based on hours recorded by the app, with additional bonuses for achieving benchmarks in mosquito and malaria reduction. This approach will not only address public health concerns but also promote socio-economic development and empowerment of women in these communities.
Moreover, the project will emphasize gender equality and human rights, ensuring the safety and well-being of participants throughout. It will include pre-training gender assessments, secure training environments, selection of communities with consideration for women's safety and provision of appropriate safety gear for field activities. This initiative is about empowering women with digital skills and tools for malaria control, fostering their economic growth, personal development, and enhancing their roles in healthcare and community leadership.
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : Malaria is almost exclusively a disease of the underprivileged. To begin with, it affects developing countries, almost all of which in Africa, and many of which with a large proportion of the population living in extreme poverty (i.e., on less than $1.90 per day). Within these countries, rural communities bear the brunt of malaria, with vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by the disease: children under the age of 5, pregnant women and–more than any other significant health issue–impoverished people. Not surprisingly, malaria is profoundly underfunded. According to the WHO, the annual resources needed in order to reach its malaria control milestones for 2025 were estimated at $6.8 billion in 2020. However, the actual funding was a mere $3.5 billion, and the funding gap is ever growing. Based on a Lancet article from 2016, the average expenditure of an African country on controlling malaria was $3 PPP. 
The flipside of this grim situation is that even incremental improvements result in multiple lives saved. Indeed, contributing to malaria prevention efforts results in one of the most lives saved per dollar donated. Our solution, which, as mentioned, has been shown to be twice as cost-effective as today's leading anti-malaria intervention, thus holds the potential of saving more than 140,000 lives annually even with existing funding. 
  The benefits of fighting malaria extend beyond saving lives, since they also contribute to the improvement of education and economic conditions. When children suffer from malaria, they often miss school days, which hinders their educational progress (this is particularly true for girls, who are often required to stay home to take care of sick family members). By reducing the incidence of malaria, children can attend school more consistently and concentrate better in class, ultimately leading to better educational outcomes. In addition, the economic situation of affected communities improves as healthier individuals can work more efficiently, boosting productivity and overall economic growth. Furthermore, in the case of digitally managed field operations to combat malaria, there are additional benefits to the community. Not only do these operations support local labor, but they also promote the acquisition of digital skills. The use of modern technology in these operations helps empower local communities, fostering self-reliance and resilience, while simultaneously providing valuable tools and resources to improve the overall effectiveness of malaria prevention initiatives.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: Zzapp was founded in 2016 by Arnon Houri-Yafin after he spent three months in hospitals in India conducting research on a malaria blood test. Witnessing the devastating impact of the disease, Arnon decided to use technology not only to diagnose malaria but to eradicate it. Zzapp team members are highly skilled professionals that are deeply committed to the cause and possess years of field experience. Zzapp’s team members hold advanced degrees, including two PhDs, from prestigious universities such as the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, Georgetown University and the Hebrew University. With a wealth of experience in diverse fields ranging from operation management and data analysis to software development and community engagement, our team has received numerous academic excellence awards and grants. Several team members have either contracted malaria themselves or lost siblings to the illness.
Despite our extensive professional and personal experience, we acknowledge that effective and sustainable solutions require a community-driven approach. We therefore continuously gather feedback through formal and informal methods. Feedback collection, led by our implementation expert, Alexandra Wharton-Smith, starts during the 3-day training that we offer fieldworkers. Based on our experiences in these sessions, we have enhanced our system, guidance materials, and teaching methods. During operations, we encourage managers and fieldworkers to share comments and suggestions via a designated WhatsApp group. We also actively seek their input during field visits, casual conversations, and structured interviews and focus groups. Overall, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both managers and workers. They have reported finding the app useful and even fun (similar to a scavenger hunt or a game of Pokémon GO…). In some instances, workers voluntarily continued working after hours to complete their assigned ""chunks,"" even after being assured that it was not expected of them. Many workers also uploaded photos of themselves standing next to water bodies they had identified, demonstrating a clear sense of pride in their accomplishments.
  
These are a few of the reviews that we received:
  
“Despite the technology’s sophistication, the app and the dashboard are very intuitive and user-friendly. In an operation in the Amhara region in 2019, we located all the water bodies, which is usually a great challenge. Fundamentally, the technology helped us in saving time and energy. It also helped us in prioritizing severely affected villages.” (Dr. Abebe Asale, the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology [ICIPE], Ethiopia, 2019
   ""The app has come at the right time. The app comes in handy in terms of helping us map all the municipality and also find the breeding sites for treatment."" (Kwame Desewu, entomologist, AngloGold Ashanti Malaria Control[AGAMal], Ghana, 2017).
 Which dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address?: Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).
 Which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals does your solution address?: 1. No Poverty, 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 5. Gender Equality, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities
 What is your solution’s stage of development?: Scale
 Please share details about why you selected the stage above.: We have a field-tested, fully functioning system – in the development of which more than $1M has been invested – whose core principle is applying local data, micro planning and thorough management on a nation-level scale. We continue to improve our tools, refine our working protocols and deepen our entomological, epidemiological and operational knowledge,  As determined by an external consultant for scalability, we are well prepared to scale up to protect hundreds of districts and towns with a population of hundreds of millions across Africa, thanks to several factors: the atomization our system facilitates; the outstanding results we have already achieved; the highly competitive price we offer; our strong ties with research institutions, implementing partners and governments; and high market demand. 
Our forthcoming solution, a women-led larviciding initiative guided by our existing digital app, represents a critical innovation that will enable the scaling of our efforts to rural areas, unlocking the full potential of larviciding in combating malaria on a national level. 
 Why are you applying to Solve?: As a Business-to-Government (B2G) company, we work with governments, but also with donors, NGOs, and policymakers, including the WHO. The involvement of multiple and varied stakeholders often results in a complex and extended sales cycle. We believe that Solve can help us surmount these challenges by facilitating vital partnerships to accelerate our efforts, validate our business model's impact and sustainability, and ultimately broaden our solution's reach to more communities in need. In addition to addressing these technical and market barriers, we seek networking opportunities to assist in completing a funding round. We have secured a term sheet from an investor (who is actually not an impact investor), contingent on the involvement of another VC in the round. We are confident that Solve can aid in identifying and connecting us with a suitable investor (VC or angel) to participate in our funding round and further advance our mission.

 What makes your solution innovative?: Our solution is distinguished in the battle against malaria by its integration of approach, functionality and technology, underpinned by a strong emphasis on community-driven efforts.
Approach: Moving beyond the prevalent reliance on insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying, our strategy focuses on community-led larviciding at outdoor water sources. This method draws on the successes of historical eradication campaigns. By mobilizing community members, in these initiatives, we leverage local knowledge and commitment, significantly boosting the impact and durability of our efforts.
Functionality: Traditional larviciding operations often face challenges with efficient management, which our solution overcomes through the strategic use of mobile technology. Our app facilitates precise coordination of treatment areas and real-time progress monitoring, ensuring comprehensive coverage and the collection of dependable data. The engagement of community members, guided by our technology, ensures an organized and effective approach, markedly improving operational performance.
Technology: Our system employs cutting-edge neural networks to analyze satellite imagery for accurate mapping of dwellings, then scrutinizes various satellite data to identify areas suitable for mosquito breeding. Armed with this data and an optimization algorithm, we meticulously plan larviciding activities, delegating manageable tasks to community-based teams. Additionally, our spatial-agent-based malaria simulator fine-tunes intervention strategies, enabling each action to achieve maximum efficacy. This technological sophistication supports community operatives, enabling them to make informed decisions, even without internet access and maintain momentum and data accuracy.
By centering our efforts on community involvement, our solution not only innovates in malaria prevention but also empowers local populations, providing valuable skills and job opportunities while tackling a major health issue. This community-centric approach seeks not just to significantly cut down malaria transmission but also to foster broader positive changes, advocating for community empowerment and collective action in public health endeavors. Our model aims to revolutionize the market landscape, showcasing the power of community-led, technologically empowered health interventions on a broad scale.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: Goal

Final Outcome
A sustainable reduction in malaria cases by 50%+ in the targeted rural areas, demonstrating that the technology and community-led approach can be scaled nationally with cost-effectiveness significantly better than existing solutions. 
 What are your impact goals for your solution and how are you measuring your progress towards them?: Our primary impact goal is to significantly reduce malaria incidence in rural areas by at least 50% on average, at a cost of less than $0.45 per person protected, demonstrating our solution's scalability and cost-effectiveness. This target reflects our commitment to transforming lives through innovative malaria control strategies, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.3 to end the malaria epidemic by 2030. We aim to showcase our technology's potential for national-level application at a cost-effectiveness that doubles that of today's leading solutions. Moreover, our approach is poised to unlock the potential for nationwide malaria elimination at the average expenditure an African country currently allocates to merely control the disease.
Measuring progress towards impact goals:
1. Malaria Incidence Reduction: We rely on official data regarding malaria incidence per 1,000 population, aligning with the UN's indicator for SDG 3.3. This allows us to directly measure our impact on reducing malaria cases in the communities we serve.
2. Mosquito Population Control: Through before, during and after comparisons of mosquito trap catches, we assess the effectiveness of our larviciding operations in reducing the adult mosquito population.
3. Mosquito Larvae Reduction: By comparing water body sampling results from mosquito breeding sites, we gauge the success of our interventions in diminishing mosquito larvae populations.
4. Cost-Effectiveness: The cost per person protected is a critical metric for us, ensuring our solution remains affordable and scalable. Achieving our goal of less than $0.45 per person underscores the financial viability and broader applicability of our approach.
 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: The core of our technology comprises an AI planning tool, a spatial-agent-based mosquito simulator, a mobile app and an online dashboard. First, our AI component extracts from satellite images the location of houses and demarcates the general area for the intervention. Then, integrating data on climate, topography and land use, it runs numerous scenarios in the simulator. Based on predicted effectiveness outcomes, it selects the specific strategy for each village, recommending where to scan for water bodies, which houses to spray, where to place mosquito traps and what implementation order to employ. The system assists with implementing the selected strategy using a GPS-based mobile app that allocates treatment areas to workers, monitors their location in the field to ensure they cover the entire area, and tracks schedules for water body treatment and other tasks. The app was designed to work in Africa’s field conditions: it has a low battery consumption, works well even on simple smartphones and can operate offline. Information from the fieldworkers, as well as that which has been obtained from drones, is automatically uploaded to the dashboard, allowing managers to monitor the operation in real time. The dashboard also produces issue-specific reports – for example, fieldworkers’ productivity or the correlation between water body type and positivity – that improve monitoring of the operation and facilitate post-operation analysis and lesson learning.

 How long have you been working on your solution? : Zzapp has been engaged in the fight against malaria for seven years. Although we have incorporated community engagement in all of our efforts, we have not yet executed a large-scale operation of the type outlined in the current proposal.
 Tell us about how you ensure that your team is diverse, minimizes barriers to opportunity for staff, and provides a welcoming and inclusive environment for all team members.: Diversity serves as a catalyst for innovation. It generates multiple perspectives on issues and fosters the development of creative solutions. Moreover, the ability to understand and empathize with others enables better addressing of the needs of customers from various cultural backgrounds. And, simply, it helps everyone feel comfortable with who they are. As a company operating in diverse cultural settings, with solutions that significantly benefit from community engagement, it is only natural that our team reflects the advantages of diversity. Our team members represent diverse genders, sexual orientations, religions, religious observances and nationalities. In this context, adopting a gender lens when addressing malaria is particularly important. Women are not only disproportionately affected by malaria (e.g., they face higher risks of mortality during pregnancy and often care for sick family members), but they also play a crucial role in malaria control efforts. Women make up 70% of the community health worker force and are instrumental in adopting malaria control practices. These practices range from ensuring that their children receive seasonal preventive medications and use bed nets, to seeking medical care at healthcare facilities when their children fall ill. It has been shown that gender integration improves malaria control. Acknowledging the importance of this perspective, we took part in writing the Gender &amp; Malaria Community of Practice Advocacy Agenda (“Eradication Through Equity: An Advocacy Agenda for a Gender Transformative Approach to the Fight Against Malaria”). We also apply a hiring policy in which if one of two equally competent candidates is a woman, she will receive the position. Indeed, women have been holding leading positions in Zzapp with regards to AI, policy and operations. Gender equality extends beyond hiring and staffing; it also involves creating supportive working conditions. For example, when our employee once had a work-related trip to a field operation in West Africa, Zzapp covered the full costs of flights and accommodations for the baby and her nanny.
 What is your business model?: Our business model focuses on providing value to the populations we serve in terms of impact and revenue through comprehensive anti-malaria vector control and surveillance services. We tailor our solutions to each location's specific needs and budgets, offering services at a competitive cost while maintaining effectiveness and profitability. 
We provide our customers, which include governments, municipalities, local authorities and implementing partners, with products and services that support the implementation of operations ranging from the municipal to the nationwide scale. Besides the software, we offer a wide gamut of services, including training, operational management, quality assurance, monitoring and community engagement. Our resources comprise digital technology, materials and equipment, logistical centers, offices, entomological labs, human resources, data and company know-how. 
  
The gains for citizens in affected countries are immense, as large-scale prevention or elimination of malaria can significantly improve public health, reduce morbidity and mortality and contribute to economic growth. Implementing partners benefit from our AI-generated tailored strategies, automated cost estimation and budgeting, improved management, highly cost-effective outcomes, increased accountability and post-analysis insights, addressing their main pain points in planning, execution and results analysis. 
  
We establish customer relationships through various channels, such as conferences, embassies, direct engagement and contact with funders like The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI). Our pre-sales process involves analyzing customers' budgets and needs and tailoring solutions accordingly. We offer a range of sales options, including district pilots, nationwide elimination, surveillance, and additional services such as modeling and consultation. 
  
Our services are delivered to citizens in collaboration with governments, local/municipal authorities, and implementing partners. We generate revenue as a B2G company, charging quarterly fees based on the number of licensed workers involved in an operation and the amount and level of services we provide. Our cost-effective solutions enable us to offer competitive pricing to our customers. 

 Do you primarily provide products or services directly to individuals, to other organizations, or to the government?: Government (B2G)
 What is your plan for becoming financially sustainable, and what evidence can you provide that this plan has been successful so far?: Our goal is to achieve financial sustainability through a revenue stream from paying customers. Our primary service, accounting for 95% of revenues until EOY 2026 and 81% of gross profit, is nationwide malaria elimination operations—a unique offering in the market. Additional services include district control for low-burden countries, urban larviciding for comprehensive city water body coverage and future platforms to combat mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika.
Our nationwide malaria elimination operations will typically begin with an eight-month, single-district paid pilot to showcase the effectiveness of our method within the client's local context. The pilot helps us tailor our system and methods to the country's specific ecosystem and society, facilitates government decision-making and bidding processes, and aids in obtaining loans from the World Bank. Following a successful pilot, we plan a three-year, two-stage nationwide campaign: a first-year ""blanket phase"" and a two-year ""targeted phase."" The final cost and structure depend on factors such as area size, population and climate. 
Based on our experience and mathematical models, we estimate that a typical 3-year nationwide elimination operation will cost the government an average annual $3.33 PPP, from which we will deliver immediate annual governmental cost savings of $1.67 PPP and major additional long-term cost savings. We will form a joint venture together with a selected implementing partner that will manage the whole sum ($300M in the case of a typical 30M population country), with which we will hire labor and transportation (70% of cost), buy aerial imagery and insecticides, run labs, and cover all the other operation costs. We will actively manage all the operational aspects of the operation. For this service, our gross profit will be $0.43 PPP or $39M (13% of the operation's total 3-year cost; according to service providers with whom we spoke, including companies and NGOs, the typical gross profit of service-givers for World Bank-funded projects is 25% of the project’s total expenditure. We aim for gross profit of between only 7% and 17% depending on the type of service and program complexity working in c","The solution provided is comprehensive, well-articulated, and addresses the challenge description effectively by leveraging technology to increase access to quality health services for medically underserved groups.

The project plans to deploy a designated mobile app to facilitate community-based larviciding in rural areas. This initiative recognizes the significant role women play in healthcare within their communities and seeks to equip them with digital tools and skills for sustainable mosquito control.

The solution operates out of Tel Aviv, Israel, under a for-profit organization model. It targets the problem of malaria, which in 2022 threatened nearly half the world's population, with 95% of cases and deaths occurring in Africa. Despite the effectiveness of traditional methods like insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), challenges such as mosquito adaptation and limited uptake have necessitated more innovative approaches. The proposal identifies a gap in current malaria control efforts, particularly in rural areas where logistical and operational challenges limit the effectiveness of existing solutions.

The proposed solution involves training women to identify and treat mosquito breeding sites using WHO-approved larvicides, supported by a mobile app leveraging GPS technology for tracking and reporting. This approach aims to tackle the high incidence of malaria in rural communities by enhancing access to healthcare and preventive services. The solution claims to be twice as cost-effective as leading anti-malaria interventions today and could potentially save more than 140,000 lives annually.

The development stage of the solution is indicated as ""Scale."" Evidence supporting this classification includes a field-tested, fully functioning system with more than $1M invested in its development. The team is looking to expand its impact across Africa, suggesting readiness for large-scale implementation. Zzapp, the team behind the proposal, demonstrates a strong foundation in technology-software development and public health, with members holding advanced degrees and having personal experiences with malaria.

The solution is designed to address several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including No Poverty, Good Health and Well-Being, Gender Equality, Reduced Inequalities, and Sustainable Cities and Communities. Their impact goals are focused on reducing malaria incidence by at least 50% in rural areas at a cost of less than $0.45 per person protected. Progress towards these goals will be measured through the reduction of malaria incidence, mosquito population control, and the cost-effectiveness of the solution.

The core technology involves AI planning tools, a spatial-agent-based mosquito simulator, a mobile app, and an online dashboard. This technological ensemble is aimed at optimizing larvicide application and enhancing the efficiency of operational management.

In terms of operational footprint, the team currently operates in Djibouti and Ghana, with plans to expand to Kenya, Mozambique, and Zambia within the next year. The business model focuses on serving governments and municipal authorities, offering comprehensive anti-malaria services at competitive costs. Evidence of financial sustainability includes grants, loans, and awards from several prestigious organizations and ongoing investment rounds.

This mission was forged through early experiences working in some of the most challenging medical environments.<br /></p>
<p>During her university years, Sonakshi completed an internship @ renowned Aravind Eye Hospital in rural India. Tasked with optimizing the hospital's administrative workflows, Sonakshi found herself immersed in day-to-day realities faced by healthcare providers serving resource-constrained communities. She witnessed the immense challenges of delivering efficient, equitable care at scale - but also the life-changing impact such innovations could have.</p>
<p>""Seeing Aravind's model of using technology and process improvements to radically expand access to essential services was truly inspiring,"" Sonakshi recalls. ""I knew then that I wanted to dedicate my career to developing solutions that could transform healthcare for vulnerable populations globally.""</p>
<p>This transformative experience, combined with Sonakshi's distinction-level master's degree in Personalized Medicine from UCL, set the stage for her next chapter. In 2020, she co-founded Your Cue, a healthcare technology start-up on a mission to enable continuous patient monitoring and early intervention.</p>
<p>Sonakshi's technical expertise, entrepreneurial drive, and personal passion for improving global health outcomes led to her being recognized as one of the Top 100 Asians in UK Tech in 2023. But her work was just getting started.</p>
<p>Joining Sonakshi in founding Your Cue was Dr. Nikhit Anilbhai, a medical doctor with a unique combination of clinical experience and advanced technical skills. Nikhit's story is one of profound personal tragedy that has fuelled an unwavering determination to save lives.</p>
<p>During the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nikhit found himself on the frontlines, treating nearly 5,000 critically ill patients across two hospitals. Working around the clock in 120-hour weeks, he witnessed first-hand the devastating human toll of healthcare system shortcomings.</p>
<p>""I gave everything I had to try and save those patients,"" Nikhit remembers. ""But I knew deep down that we needed new innovations to provide the kind of timely, proactive care that could truly make a difference.""</p>
<p>Tragically, Nikhit's own father passed away shortly after, suffering complications that went undetected until it was too late. This personal loss crystallized Nikhit's mission - to develop technologies that could monitor patients continuously and trigger early interventions, preventing unnecessary deaths.</p>
<p>With Sonakshi's expertise in healthcare innovation and Nikhit's frontline medical experience, their second project, the Heart-Alert wearable, aims to transform outcomes for millions of people at high risk of sudden cardiac arrest worldwide.</p>
<p>To ensure the device truly meets the needs of high-risk cardiac patients, they are actively engaging with focus groups, patient advocacy organizations, and community healthcare providers. This allows them to incorporate the first-hand experiences, ideas, and agendas of the elderly, those with cardiovascular conditions, and individuals living independently or in care facilities.</p>
<p>The team is also partnering with local emergency services to align the Heart-Alert system with existing protocols and infrastructure, enabling seamless integration that empowers equitable access for underserved populations. This community-centric approach is central to the solution's design and implementation to maximize its real-world impact.</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","3. Good Health and Well-Being, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 15. Life on Land",Prototype,"<p>Your Cue has developed an initial prototype for the Heart-Alert wearable device, which they are now seeking to advance to the next stage of development.</p>
<p>The key details about their current progress are:</p>
<p><strong>Prototype Development:</strong> <br /><br />Your Cue has already developed a version 1 of the Heart-Alert device that utilizes a combination of PPG, single-lead ECG, temperature, and motion sensors to continuously monitor the user's vital signs. This prototype has demonstrated the ability to detect abnormal heart rate patterns (using PPG raw data analysis) indicative of cardiac arrhythmias and trigger detailed ECG recordings that could then be used to alert emergency services and to guide clinicians in following check ups. It is a finger based device, capable of fitting multiple finger sizes and has integrated cellular connectivity and GPS.<br /><br />Even though the sensors being used within the device are renowned for their clinical grade accuracy, they along with the built in algorithms have yet to be tested on real life subjects with significant cardiac anomalies and the sensitivity and specificity of the device with respect to cardiac arrest detection are yet to be determined.<br /><br />The team is currently scouting for partnerships with local emergency services within the UK and is looking to soft test the solution with real life users.</p>
<p><strong>Innovate UK Funding</strong>: <br /><br />The company has previously secured funding from Innovate UK to support the development of this prototype, indicating that the innovation has already undergone some level of technical validation and feasibility testing.</p>","<p>As the co-founders of Your Cue, Sonakshi Senthil and Dr. Nikhit Anilbhai are applying to the MIT Solve program with the goal of overcoming key technical, market, and legal barriers to accelerate the development and deployment of their life-saving Heart-Alert ecosystem and finger based device.</p>
<p>Sonakshi explains, ""While we've made important progress in developing a functional prototype, we now face the challenge of scaling our innovation to deliver real-world impact at the pace required to address the urgent cardiac arrest crisis. Solve's unique program and ecosystem can provide immense value in helping us overcome these hurdles.""</p>
<p>The primary technical barriers lie in further refining the Heart-Alert's embedded firmware for enhanced battery life, enhancing the machine learning algorithms for more accurate cardiac event detection, and rigorously validating the device's performance through comprehensive clinical trials. ""As a medical doctor and researcher turned entrepreneur, I know how critical it is to get these technical elements right to ensure our solution is both effective and safe,"" notes Dr. Anilbhai. ""Solve's access to world-class technical experts and resources could be transformative in helping us overcome these barriers.""</p>
<p>Beyond the technological challenges, the team also faces significant market access and adoption hurdles. Sonakshi elaborates, ""Integrating Heart-Alert with emergency response systems and care provider workflows is essential, but navigating these complex healthcare ecosystems requires specialized knowledge, especially since the system varies significantly from region to region''</p>
<p>Perhaps most critically, the development and deployment of a cardiac emergency detection wearable like Heart-Alert raises important legal and regulatory considerations that the Your Cue team would require MIT Solve's guidance and support to navigate effectively:</p>
<p>Key legal risks include data privacy concerns, liability for false negative alerts, and integration with emergency response systems. However, the immense potential benefits of saving thousands of lives annually could outweigh these challenges with the right legal frameworks and partnerships facilitated by Solve.</p>
<p>Lastly, the team currently lacks the financial resources to fully execute on their ambitious roadmap. ""As a young start-up, we simply don't have the capital required to accelerate our development, conduct large-scale clinical trials, and drive broad commercialization,"" says Sonakshi. ""The funding, investment, and fundraising assistance offered through Solve could be a game-changer in turning our proof-of-concept into a deployable solution that saves lives.""</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Your Cue team's combination of technical expertise, personal motivation, and market understanding positions them uniquely to deliver the Heart-Alert solution. But the support and partnership opportunities provided by MIT Solve could be the catalyst needed to accelerate their impact and save thousands of lives. As Sonakshi concludes, ""Solve isn't just a funding opportunity - it's a chance to unlock our full potential as proximate leaders driving meaningful change.""</p>","Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Legal or Regulatory Matters, Product / Service Distribution (e.g. delivery, logistics, expanding client base), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)",Sonakshi Senthil,No,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Google or other search engine,<p>Read about it on Google</p>,"<p>The Heart-Alert wearable device represents a ground-breaking, innovative approach to addressing the global crisis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs).

This allows the device to detect the earliest physiological signs of a cardiac emergency, even when the user is unable to activate the system themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Cardiac Event Detection AI:</strong> The device's sophisticated machine learning algorithms analyze this real-time multimodal sensor data to identify patterns indicative of life-threatening cardiac events like arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. This AI-powered analytics engine will be able to recognize these critical situations with a high degree of accuracy, eliminating the need for human witnesses to diagnose the emergency.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Emergency Activation:</strong> Once the Heart-Alert's AI detects a cardiac emergency, the device instantly triggers an alert. It automatically contacts the Your Cue 24*7 helpline team and the emergency services, using inbuilt cellular connectivity and shares the user's precise GPS location, even notifying nearby registered responders - all within seconds of the crisis onset. This radically reduces the time to emergency response, a critical factor driving improved OHCA survival rates.</p>
<p><em>This combination of continuous monitoring, advanced analytics, and autonomous emergency activation represents a transformative leap beyond current solutions that still rely on human intervention. By taking the need for a witness out of the loop, Heart-Alert addresses the major gap where over 50% of OHCAs occur without any witnesses present to call for help.</em></p>

<p>By addressing these critical gaps through the innovative Heart-Alert technology, the proposed theory of change outlines a clear pathway to dramatically improve outcomes for the millions affected by out-of-hospital cardiac arrests worldwide by increasing their survival rate as well as improving the quality of life for survivors.</p>","<p>The primary impact goals for the Heart-Alert solution are to <strong>significantly improve survival rates and long-term outcomes</strong> for individuals experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs). Specifically, we aim to:<br /></p>
<p><strong>1. Increase OHCA survival rates from the current 10% to at least 30% within 3 years of widespread deployment.</strong></p><p> The current low survival rates for OHCA are unacceptable, particularly given that faster response times, witnessed collapses, and early defibrillation can dramatically improve chances of survival. Heart-Alert aims to address this by automatically detecting cardiac emergencies and instantly alerting emergency services and nearby responders, eliminating the critical delays caused by lack of witnesses.</p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>. Reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment and other long-term complications in OHCA survivors by 50%. </strong></p><p>Currently, over 10% of OHCA survivors suffer debilitating cognitive impairments and reduced quality of life due to the prolonged lack of oxygen to the brain. By reducing response times and enabling faster access to life-saving interventions, Heart-Alert can mitigate this devastating outcome and allow survivors to regain their quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>3. Improve equitable access to lifesaving OHCA detection and emergency care,</strong> e<em>specially in underserved and deprived communities that currently have lower bystander CPR rates and less access to public defibrillators.</em></p><p> Cardiac arrest incidence, bystander CPR, and defibrillator access are all significantly lower in more deprived areas and those with higher ethnic minority populations. Heart-Alert will help address these health disparities by providing automated detection and emergency activation regardless of witness presence or bystander intervention.</p>
<p>To track progress towards these impact goals, we will monitor a combination of <strong>clinical, operational, and user engagement metrics:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Metrics:</strong><br />- OHCA survival rates in pilot deployment areas, with a target of at least 30% within 3 years<br />- Incidence of post-OHCA cognitive impairment and other complications in pilot sites, aiming for a 50% reduction to current standards<br />- Time from cardiac arrest onset to emergency services dispatch and first responder arrival, with a target of under 5 minutes (currently there are no metrics for the same)</p>
<p><strong>Operational Metrics: </strong><br />- Bystander CPR rates and public defibrillator use in pilot communities, particularly in areas with higher deprivation and ethnic minority populations<br />- Adoption and utilization of the Heart-Alert system by emergency services, healthcare providers, and at-risk patients</p>
<p><strong>User Engagement Metrics:</strong><br />- Satisfaction and feedback from OHCA victims, their families, and healthcare providers utilizing the Heart-Alert system<br />- Engagement and retention rates among high-risk patient populations using the Heart-Alert device</p>
<p>We will collect this data through a combination of medical record reviews, community surveys, usage analytics, and user feedback mechanisms. This data will be analyzed quarterly to assess progress towards our impact goals and inform ongoing refinements to the Heart-Alert solution and deployment strategy.</p>","<p>At the heart of the Heart-Alert solution is a combination of cutting-edge sensors and machine learning (ML) platform that enables real-time detection of cardiac emergencies. The device uses a combination of photoplethysmography (PPG), single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), skin temperature, and motion sensors to continuously monitor the user's vital signs.<br /></p>
<p>The PPG sensor captures changes in blood volume under the skin, allowing the system to detect abnormal heart rhythms, oxygen saturation drops and other cardiovascular irregularities. The single-lead ECG provides an additional data source to confirm any suspected arrhythmias or other cardiac events initially detected by the PPG. The skin temperature and motion sensors help the system differentiate between cardiac episodes and other physiological events like seizures or falls.</p>
<p>This sensor data is processed by advanced deep neural networks trained on large datasets of cardiac events and physiological patterns. The ML models are designed to rapidly identify the signatures of various life-threatening conditions, including different types of arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, seizures, and sudden collapses. </p>

 What specific problem are you solving?: The Unmet Need: Dramatically Improving Cardiac Arrest Survival Rates
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) represent a critical global health crisis, claiming over 500,000 lives annually across Europe and 350,000 in the United States alone. In the UK, the incidence is approximately 55 per 100,000 adults, resulting in around 30,000 EMS-attended OHCAs every year. However, the survival rate remains shockingly low at less than 10%.
This staggeringly high mortality is driven by two key factors: 1) delays in emergency recognition and activation, and 2) lack of immediate life-saving interventions like CPR and defibrillation.Over 35% of OHCA cases occur without any witness present to call emergency services, leaving the victim's collapse unnoticed. Even when 999/911 is called immediately, average ambulance response times of 7 to 9 minutes decrease the chance of survival by 60-90%.
Furthermore, significant health disparities exist, with more deprived communities and higher ethnic minority populations experiencing higher OHCA rates, lower bystander CPR, and less access to public defibrillators. This compounds the problem, leaving already vulnerable populations at even greater risk.
The Innovative Solution: Automated OHCA Detection and Emergency Activation
Your Cue's finger based wearable device (The Cue Ring) addresses these critical gaps through an automated, AI-powered solution. By continuously monitoring vital signs including PPG, temperature, single lead ECG (non-continuous) and motion, the device can rapidly detect changes and physiological patterns indicative of cardiac arrest. When an OHCA event is identified, the device immediately alerts emergency services, using in built cellular connectivity and shares the user's GPS location, and can even prompt nearby registered first responders - all without relying on human witnesses.
This breakthrough innovation fundamentally transforms OHCA emergency response by eliminating the delays caused by waiting for someone to recognize the crisis and call 999/911. Instead, life-saving interventions can be activated within seconds of cardiac arrest onset, drastically improving the odds of survival.
Scalable Impact and Healthcare System Integration
If deployed widely, Your Cue's technology has the potential to save thousands of lives annually in the UK and over a quarter-million globally. By enabling faster emergency activation and increasing bystander CPR and defibrillation rates, the device could boost OHCA survival from the current 10% up to 30-50% - a transformative impact.
The solution's seamless integration with local ambulance services and compatibility with existing emergency response infrastructure will ensure equitable nationwide access, addressing the disparities seen in current outcomes. Additionally, the device's affordability and suitability for deployment in care homes, hospitals, and high-risk patient populations can further broaden its lifesaving reach.
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests represent a massive global health challenge claiming over 850,000 lives yearly across Europe and the US. Your Cue's innovative wearable device, leveraging advanced AI, enhanced machine learning and multi-sensor data, directly addresses the key drivers of this crisis - delayed emergency activation and lack of immediate intervention. By automating the detection and alerting process, the solution has immense potential to dramatically improve survival rates and save countless lives, while also tackling the inequities that currently plague OHCA outcomes.
 What is your solution?: Heart-Alert: An Automated Cardiac Arrest Detection and Emergency Alerting Wearable 
Despite advancements in emergency medical care, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) remain a leading cause of preventable death worldwide. In the US alone, there are approximately 300,000 EMS-attended OHCA cases annually, with a survival rate of less than 10%. Tragically, over 50% of these events occur without any witnesses present to recognize the emergency and call for help. Even when 911 is contacted immediately in US, average ambulance response times of 7 minutes can decrease the victim's chance of survival by 60-90%.
This critical gap in rapid emergency activation is the key challenge addressed by the Heart-Alert wearable device. Leveraging a combination of advanced sensor technologies, machine learning algorithms and built in artificial intelligence, Heart-Alert provides an automated, life-saving solution.
At the core of Heart-Alert is a compact, finger-worn form factor that continuously monitors the user's vital signs (The Cue Ring). Cutting-edge photoplethysmography (PPG), single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), temperature, and motion sensors collect real-time physiological data. Sophisticated machine learning algorithms then analyze this multimodal sensor input to instantly detect the unique patterns indicative of a cardiac anomaly.
Once the device's AI identifies and confirms a high-probability cardiac emergency, Heart-Alert springs into action. It automatically sends an emergency alert to Your Cue's 24*7 help centre, simultaneously uploading all vital sign data collected within the last 15 minutes. The Your Cue team confirms the emergency in the next 120 seconds and forwards the alert to the local ambulance dispatch centre, transmitting the user's precise GPS coordinates to enable the fastest possible response. Simultaneously, the device can notify nearby registered volunteer first responders, prompting them to rush to the scene and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation before EMS arrives.
This ability to activate the emergency response within seconds of cardiac arrest onset is a game-changing innovation. It eliminates the critical delays caused by waiting for a bystander to recognize the crisis and dial 999. By empowering immediate life-saving interventions, Heart-Alert has immense potential to dramatically improve OHCA survival rates, which decrease by 7-10% with each minute of delay.
Beyond the device's core cardiac arrest detection and alerting capabilities, Heart-Alert also incorporates features to enhance user safety and wellness. Built-in fall detection can trigger emergency notifications if the user experiences a dangerous fall or loss of consciousness. The device can also track long-term trends in the user's heart rate, activity levels, and other vital signs, providing valuable data to support proactive healthcare management.
Heart-Alert represents a quantum leap forward in out-of-hospital cardiac emergency response. By seamlessly integrating advanced sensor technologies, machine learning, and automated emergency activation, this innovative wearable has the power to save millions of lives globally. With the potential to boost OHCA survival from less than 10% to as high as 50%, Heart-Alert offers a transformative solution to one of the world's most pressing healthcare challenges.
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : Heart-Alert's target population is individuals at high risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, particularly those with underlying cardiovascular conditions, the elderly, and those living alone or in care facilities. These groups are currently underserved due to several critical gaps:
High OHCA Incidence and Mortality Rates: The British Heart Foundation reports that 7.6 million people in the UK suffer from cardiovascular diseases, and the American Heart Association states that nearly half of all people in the U.S. (48.6%) have some type of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke and, most notably, high blood pressure putting them at elevated risk of sudden cardiac arrest. However, the survival rate for OHCA remains dismal, with less than 1 in 10 individuals surviving. This disproportionately impacts the elderly, who account for the majority of OHCA cases.Delayed Emergency Response: Over 50% of OHCA events occur without any witnesses present to recognize the crisis and call emergency services. Even when 999/911 is contacted immediately, average ambulance response times of 7-9 minutes decrease survival odds by 60-90%. This delay in activating life-saving interventions is a critical barrier for high-risk populations, especially those living alone or in care facilities.Lack of Bystander CPR and Defibrillation: Research shows that immediate CPR and defibrillation dramatically improve OHCA outcomes, yet bystander CPR rates remain low, occurring in only 40% of cases that are discovered. Access to public defibrillators is also limited, particularly in more deprived areas with higher ethnic minority populations, with some stats showing that an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is used prior to EMS arrival, only ~2% of the time. This leaves already vulnerable groups at an even greater disadvantage.
Heart-Alert will directly address these pressing needs through its automated cardiac event detection and emergency notification capabilities. By continuously monitoring the user's vital signs and leveraging advanced AI, the finger based device can identify the unique physiological patterns indicative of cardiac arrest within seconds. It then instantly activates emergency services, shares the user's location, and even prompts nearby registered responders - all without requiring human intervention.
This breakthrough innovation has immense potential to transform OHCA outcomes for the target high-risk population. By eliminating the delays in recognizing the emergency and calling for help, Heart-Alert can boost the chances of survival from the current dismal 10% up to 30-50%. This dramatic improvement in survivability could save thousands of lives annually, especially among the elderly and those living independently.
Moreover, Heart-Alert's seamless integration with local emergency response systems ensures equitable access, addressing the disparities seen in current OHCA outcomes. The device's affordability and suitability for deployment in care homes, hospitals, and other high-risk settings further broadens its reach to serve the most vulnerable populations.
Heart-Alert's target users are individuals at elevated risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, particularly the elderly, those with cardiovascular conditions, and those living alone or in care facilities. By automating the detection and emergency activation process, the wearable device directly addresses the critical gaps in rapid response that disproportionately impact these underserved groups.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: Sonakshi Senthil has always been driven by a deep passion for improving healthcare standards. This mission was forged through early experiences working in some of the most challenging medical environments.
During her university years, Sonakshi completed an internship @ renowned Aravind Eye Hospital in rural India. Tasked with optimizing the hospital's administrative workflows, Sonakshi found herself immersed in day-to-day realities faced by healthcare providers serving resource-constrained communities. She witnessed the immense challenges of delivering efficient, equitable care at scale - but also the life-changing impact such innovations could have.
""Seeing Aravind's model of using technology and process improvements to radically expand access to essential services was truly inspiring,"" Sonakshi recalls. ""I knew then that I wanted to dedicate my career to developing solutions that could transform healthcare for vulnerable populations globally.""
This transformative experience, combined with Sonakshi's distinction-level master's degree in Personalized Medicine from UCL, set the stage for her next chapter. In 2020, she co-founded Your Cue, a healthcare technology start-up on a mission to enable continuous patient monitoring and early intervention.
Sonakshi's technical expertise, entrepreneurial drive, and personal passion for improving global health outcomes led to her being recognized as one of the Top 100 Asians in UK Tech in 2023. But her work was just getting started.
Joining Sonakshi in founding Your Cue was Dr. Nikhit Anilbhai, a medical doctor with a unique combination of clinical experience and advanced technical skills. Nikhit's story is one of profound personal tragedy that has fuelled an unwavering determination to save lives.
During the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nikhit found himself on the frontlines, treating nearly 5,000 critically ill patients across two hospitals. Working around the clock in 120-hour weeks, he witnessed first-hand the devastating human toll of healthcare system shortcomings.
""I gave everything I had to try and save those patients,"" Nikhit remembers. ""But I knew deep down that we needed new innovations to provide the kind of timely, proactive care that could truly make a difference.""
Tragically, Nikhit's own father passed away shortly after, suffering complications that went undetected until it was too late. This personal loss crystallized Nikhit's mission - to develop technologies that could monitor patients continuously and trigger early interventions, preventing unnecessary deaths.
With Sonakshi's expertise in healthcare innovation and Nikhit's frontline medical experience, their second project, the Heart-Alert wearable, aims to transform outcomes for millions of people at high risk of sudden cardiac arrest worldwide.
To ensure the device truly meets the needs of high-risk cardiac patients, they are actively engaging with focus groups, patient advocacy organizations, and community healthcare providers. This allows them to incorporate the first-hand experiences, ideas, and agendas of the elderly, those with cardiovascular conditions, and individuals living independently or in care facilities.
The team is also partnering with local emergency services to align the Heart-Alert system with existing protocols and infrastructure, enabling seamless integration that empowers equitable access for underserved populations. This community-centric approach is central to the solution's design and implementation to maximize its real-world impact.

Greater accessibility and utilization of the Heart-Alert device among high-risk populations, including the elderly, those with cardiovascular conditions, and individuals living independently or in care facilities.
Long-Term Outcomes:Through these immediate outcomes, the Heart-Alert solution is expected to drive the following long-term, high-level impacts:1. Significantly improved survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) incidents, increasing from the current dismal 10% up to 30-50%.2. Significantly reduced disability and improved quality of life for OHCA survivors, as earlier intervention prevents or mitigates anoxic brain injury.3. More equitable access to emergency cardiac care, addressing the disparities seen in current OHCA outcomes across socioeconomic and demographic lines.4. Reduced strain on emergency medical services and healthcare systems by enabling faster response and treatment of cardiac emergencies.Evidence Supporting the Theory of Change:The causal links in this theory of change are grounded in extensive research on OHCA epidemiology and emergency response:- Studies show that each minute of delay in defibrillation decreases OHCA survival by 7-10%.- Approximately 50% of OHCA cases occur without any witnesses present to activate emergency services.- Faster emergency response times and bystander CPR are strongly correlated with higher OHCA survival rates.- Disparities exist in OHCA incidence, bystander CPR, and access to defibrillators across socioeconomic and demographic lines.
By addressing these critical gaps through the innovative Heart-Alert technology, the proposed theory of change outlines a clear pathway to dramatically improve outcomes for the millions affected by out-of-hospital cardiac arrests worldwide by increasing their survival rate as well as improving the quality of life for survivors.
 What are your impact goals for your solution and how are you measuring your progress towards them?: The primary impact goals for the Heart-Alert solution are to significantly improve survival rates and long-term outcomes for individuals experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs). Specifically, we aim to:
1. Increase OHCA survival rates from the current 10% to at least 30% within 3 years of widespread deployment. The current low survival rates for OHCA are unacceptable, particularly given that faster response times, witnessed collapses, and early defibrillation can dramatically improve chances of survival. Heart-Alert aims to address this by automatically detecting cardiac emergencies and instantly alerting emergency services and nearby responders, eliminating the critical delays caused by lack of witnesses.2. Reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment and other long-term complications in OHCA survivors by 50%. Currently, over 10% of OHCA survivors suffer debilitating cognitive impairments and reduced quality of life due to the prolonged lack of oxygen to the brain. By reducing response times and enabling faster access to life-saving interventions, Heart-Alert can mitigate this devastating outcome and allow survivors to regain their quality of life.
3. Improve equitable access to lifesaving OHCA detection and emergency care, especially in underserved and deprived communities that currently have lower bystander CPR rates and less access to public defibrillators. Cardiac arrest incidence, bystander CPR, and defibrillator access are all significantly lower in more deprived areas and those with higher ethnic minority populations. Heart-Alert will help address these health disparities by providing automated detection and emergency activation regardless of witness presence or bystander intervention.
To track progress towards these impact goals, we will monitor a combination of clinical, operational, and user engagement metrics:
Clinical Metrics:- OHCA survival rates in pilot deployment areas, with a target of at least 30% within 3 years- Incidence of post-OHCA cognitive impairment and other complications in pilot sites, aiming for a 50% reduction to current standards- Time from cardiac arrest onset to emergency services dispatch and first responder arrival, with a target of under 5 minutes (currently there are no metrics for the same)
Operational Metrics: - Bystander CPR rates and public defibrillator use in pilot communities, particularly in areas with higher deprivation and ethnic minority populations- Adoption and utilization of the Heart-Alert system by emergency services, healthcare providers, and at-risk patients
User Engagement Metrics:- Satisfaction and feedback from OHCA victims, their families, and healthcare providers utilizing the Heart-Alert system- Engagement and retention rates among high-risk patient populations using the Heart-Alert device
We will collect this data through a combination of medical record reviews, community surveys, usage analytics, and user feedback mechanisms. This data will be analyzed quarterly to assess progress towards our impact goals and inform ongoing refinements to the Heart-Alert solution and deployment strategy.
 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: At the heart of the Heart-Alert solution is a combination of cutting-edge sensors and machine learning (ML) platform that enables real-time detection of cardiac emergencies. The device uses a combination of photoplethysmography (PPG), single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), skin temperature, and motion sensors to continuously monitor the user's vital signs.
The PPG sensor captures changes in blood volume under the skin, allowing the system to detect abnormal heart rhythms, oxygen saturation drops and other cardiovascular irregularities. The single-lead ECG provides an additional data source to confirm any suspected arrhythmias or other cardiac events initially detected by the PPG. The skin temperature and motion sensors help the system differentiate between cardiac episodes and other physiological events like seizures or falls.
This sensor data is processed by advanced deep neural networks trained on large datasets of cardiac events and physiological patterns. The ML models are designed to rapidly identify the signatures of various life-threatening conditions, including different types of arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, seizures, and sudden collapses. 
By integrating these sensors and AI-powered analytics, the Heart-Alert device can automatically detect the ons","The solution provided by Heart-Alert is comprehensive, well-detailed, and addresses a critical global health issue—out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs)—with an innovative approach leveraging AI and wearable technology.

86838,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,We are building a cutting-edge software platform to democratize and streamline access to effective substance use treatment.,"Cambridge, MA, USA",United States,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>Laptis is committed to uniting the fragmented and opaque substance use treatment landscape. The current landscape is incredibly confusing, disjointed, and overwhelmingly complex – there is no centralized platform to assist people’s search, so the next best option is a nightmarish combination of half-cooked google searches and dozens of frustrating phone calls that drag out long hold times and require the same information to be repeated over and over. As a result, treatment referral and coordination processes are exponentially less efficient and effective than they should be. This has broad implications, affecting tens of millions of individuals across the United States; contributing to systemic inefficiencies within healthcare and legal systems; and having visceral pain points for demand side professionals, clients, and treatment centers alike.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Scale:
  </p>
<p>Nearly 20 million Americans currently struggle with substance use disorders, and there are tens of millions more who have overcome this problem in the past. There is an immense need for effective treatment options and efficient referral processes.
  </p>
<p>The annual direct and indirect costs of addiction in the United States surpass $3 trillion, underscoring the economic impact of the crisis and the urgent need for efficient treatment referral systems.
  </p>
<p>This problem adversely impacts three distinct stakeholders: demand side professionals (social workers, lawyers, doctors), patients, and supply side entities (treatment centers). 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Impact on Demand Side:
  </p>
<p>Legal, medical, and social service professionals, who are integral to the referral process for millions of Americans seeking treatment, face significant challenges due to the fragmented landscape. Many spend 2-6 hours per day searching for treatment options for their clients, making 10-20 phone calls just to ascertain crucial details and availability, which is time that could be better spent on direct patient care and other responsibilities.
  </p>
<p>This inefficiency not only has a profound opportunity cost but also contributes to the financial burden on healthcare and legal systems, making the need for a streamlined solution like Laptis evident.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Impact on Clients:
  </p>
<p>The lack of a streamlined referral process leads to clients often being placed in the first available treatment option, rather than the most suitable one. This misalignment between client needs and treatment programs can lead to poorer health outcomes and increased rates of relapse, exacerbating the personal and societal costs of substance use disorders.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Impact on Treatment Centers:
  </p>
<p>Treatment centers themselves face challenges in reaching their target clientele efficiently, with significant investments in marketing and outreach often not resulting in optimal patient matches and bed utilization. This inefficiency underscores the need for a platform like Laptis that can connect treatment centers with suitable clients more effectively.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By addressing these key challenges, Laptis aims to build a software platform that revolutionizes the way treatment referrals are made, improving outcomes for demand side professionals, clients, and treatment centers. Our platform aligns the incentives of all three stakeholders so ensure cooperation and continued growth through network effects. </p>","<p>Laptis is building a transformative end-to-end platform designed to streamline the complex and fragmented process of connecting individuals with effective substance use treatment. Our platform serves as a centralized marketplace, facilitating efficient and informed treatment referrals by bridging the gap between lawyers, physicians, and social workers (demand side entities), clients seeking treatment, and substance use treatment centers (supply side entities).</p>
<p>How Laptis Works:
  </p>
<p>Centralized Platform: At its core, Laptis functions as a comprehensive platform connecting demand side entities to treatment centers in real time. Demand side professionals answer 10-15 questions about their clients, and the platform immediately presents them with multiple available and appropriate treatment options, allowing them to make informed choices about treatment options in minutes as opposed to hours or days. To inform their choices, users can easily access availability, intake requirements, treatment modalities, bespoke features, and user reviews. On the other side of the network, treatment centers can have efficient and targeted access towards inbound clients, enabling them to attract ideal clients much more effectively.
  </p>
<p>Recommendation Algorithm: Utilizing advanced algorithms and machine learning, Laptis recommends clients for certain treatment options that best fit their specific needs and circumstances. This matching process considers various factors, including the severity of the substance use disorder, location preferences, insurance coverage, and any co-occurring mental health conditions, ensuring a personalized approach to treatment referral.
  </p>
<p>User-Friendly Interface: Designed with accessibility in mind, the Laptis platform features an intuitive user interface that simplifies the process of searching for and connecting with treatment centers. Professionals can easily navigate the platform, compare different treatment options, and initiate the referral process – all within a few clicks.
  </p>
<p>Data Analytics and Insights: Beyond matching and referral, Laptis collects and analyzes data to offer insights into treatment outcomes, treatment center effectiveness, and systemic trends. This feature supports continuous improvement in the substance use treatment landscape, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and governments to improve policies.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In sum, Laptis is a technology platform that simplifies the process of finding and connecting with substance use treatment centers. By providing an accessible, data-driven, and user-friendly solution, Laptis saves time for demand side professionals, allows clients to make informed decisions, and enables more efficient treatment center customer acquisition – all of which improves substance use outcomes. 
</p>","<p>Laptis serves three groups within the substance use treatment ecosystem: lawyers, physicians, and social workers (demand side entities); individuals seeking substance use disorder treatment (clients); and substance use treatment centers (supply side entities). Each of these groups faces unique and important challenges, all of which Laptis will address.</p>
<p>Demand Side Entities:
  </p>
<p>Demand side entities are critically positioned to assist individuals in need of substance use treatment and facilitate their connection to appropriate care. However, they currently face significant barriers due to the lack of a centralized, reliable source of information on treatment options. Many spend several hours a day navigating a disjointed system to find suitable treatment facilities for their clients. This not only detracts from their capacity to perform other vital duties, but it also delays the initiation of treatment for individuals in need.
  </p>
<p>Impact of Laptis: By providing a streamlined, easy-to-use platform with real-time information on treatment centers, Laptis significantly reduces the time and effort required for demand side entities to find appropriate options for their clients. This enables professionals to more efficiently allocate their resources, spend more time on direct client care, and improve overall outcomes for the populations they serve.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Clients:
  </p>
<p>Clients are often vulnerable individuals struggling to navigate the complex and opaque landscape of SUD treatment. The current system's lack of transparency and accessibility means that many clients are placed in the “first available bed” – which are often programs that are not appropriate for their specific needs, leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes and increased rates of relapse.
  </p>
<p>Impact of Laptis: For clients, Laptis offers a pathway to more informed choices about appropriate treatment. By facilitating matches based on individual needs, preferences, and circumstances, Laptis ensures that clients are more likely to engage with and complete treatment programs tailored to their unique situations. This personalized approach is expected to improve treatment outcomes and ultimately support more sustainable recoveries.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Substance Use Treatment Centers:
  </p>
<p>Treatment centers are essential providers within this ecosystem, yet they often struggle to find enough clients that are a good fit for their services. Current reliance on inefficient marketing strategies and high-friction referral processes makes it challenging for these centers to optimize their bed and resource capacity. More efficient and effective marketing processes could save millions of dollars per treatment center to be otherwise spent on care.
  </p>
<p>Impact of Laptis: Laptis addresses this issue by attracting a high density of senders and clients, thereby providing a highly accessible pool of potential customers for treatment centers to target. This not only enhances the centers' operational efficiency, but it also improves their capacity to deliver effective treatment, as programs can be more effectively tailored to the needs of their client base.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In sum, Laptis effectively serves the needs of demand side entities, clients, and treatment centers. Through its innovative platform, Laptis aims to transform the substance use treatment landscape into a more accessible, efficient, and effective system, leading to improved client health outcomes and increased operational capacities for senders and treatment centers.
</p>","<p>Our team is deeply connected to the communities we aim to serve. Our shared commitment to improving the substance use treatment landscape is driven by personal experiences, professional encounters, and a collective mission to enact change.</p>
<p>Andrew Steen, our CEO, exemplifies the spirit of service and dedication that underpins Laptis' mission. His decision to become an Army Ranger was fueled by a profound commitment to serving his country and community in a meaningful way. Andrew’s experiences in high-stakes special operations environments sharpened his understanding of teamwork, leadership, and the complexities of navigating challenging situations. 
  </p>
<p>However, it was also during his time in the Army that Andrew confronted the stark realities of inequality that pervade our society. Andrew saw that many drivers of inequality were exacerbated by substance use issues and inaccessibility of treatment – both within the veteran community and the United States more broadly. Witnessing the impacts of these disparities, Andrew became acutely aware of systemic contributors to cycles of poverty, incarceration, and addiction. 
  </p>
<p>This realization sparked a determination in Andrew to address these contributors in a tangible way: by starting Laptis. Andrew’s experiences in the Army, coupled with his academic pursuits in law and business, equipped him with a unique skill set and perspective to disrupt the substance use treatment landscape in a prosocial way.
  </p>
<p>Andrew's journey from serving in the Army to spearheading Laptis is a testament to his belief that to truly serve one's country, one must address the underlying issues that affect its most vulnerable populations. His leadership at Laptis is driven by this ethos, ensuring that the platform not only serves as a technological solution but also as a means to advance equity and access in substance use treatment.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The remainder of our all-star team is a mix of technologists, healthcare practitioners, individuals with lived experience recovery, and aspiring legal professionals. This diversity ensures a wide range of perspectives and insights into the solution's design and implementation, making our platform more inclusive and effective.
  </p>
<p>One notable teammate, Tara Rivera, embodies our team's deep connection to the community. With her personal decades-long journey in recovery and her professional background in management at a leading substance use treatment center, Tara brings invaluable insights into both the needs of individuals seeking treatment and the operational realities of treatment centers. Her dual perspectives allow us to deeply understand the painful uphill battle that millions of clients face, while simultaneously building a business that can create and capture value from treatment centers. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From the outset, Laptis has been developed in close collaboration with our target communities. This includes ongoing dialogues with legal, medical, and social service professionals, as well as individuals in recovery and treatment centers. We have conducted extensive interviews, user tests, pilot programs, and feedback sessions to ensure that our platform addresses the specific needs and preferences of all stakeholders. Laptis is more than a platform: it is a community-driven solution, shaped by the very individuals it seeks to support.
</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","3. Good Health and Well-Being, 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 16. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions",Pilot,"<p>We selected “pilot” because we launched our solution in the Boston legal community in late February. We are working closely with four law firms and engaging ten attorneys in total – this initial engagement has also sparked strong verbal interest from five additional firms. Our pilot is hands-on and analog, signifying our commitment to understanding the intricate dynamics and unknown unknowns of treatment referrals before automating the process (we want to fail fast and not fail at scale).</p>
<p>What We've Built and Tested:
  </p>
<p>To date, we've developed an intake system using a Google survey and built a comprehensive spreadsheet database of 160 Boston-area treatment centers. This database is organized by over 30 columns of data per treatment center, covering information such as stage, location, demographic qualifications, insurance requirements, and treatment philosophy. Our current process is as follows: (1) attorneys fill out the intake form on behalf of their clients; (2) Andrew manually cross-references their responses with the database to identify a list of best fit treatment centers; (3) Andrew calls each center directly to confirm availability and intake feasibility; (4) Andrew provides the attorneys with 2-5 suitable options from which they and their clients can choose.
  </p>
<p>This process, albeit unscalable, is instrumental in validating a core hypotheses: that we can deliver significant value to demand-side entities by connecting them with treatment centers. Affirming this hypothesis is a huge step to achieving sufficient demand-side client density for efficient treatment center customer acquisition (one of our ultimate monetization strategies). Having Andrew essentially become the algorithm at first is also a crucial step in learning, as it helps us test and iterate on the below categories: 
  </p>
<p>Algorithm Development: We're gaining insights into the necessary steps to go from intake form data to suitable treatment centers. This is laying the groundwork for automating the matching and availability discovery processes in the future. 
  </p>
<p>Intake Form Optimization: Feedback from our initial users is helping us refine the questions on our intake form, ensuring we gather all necessary information to facilitate effective matches.
  </p>
<p>Data Collection Strategy: We're identifying the most critical data points to track regarding clients and treatment centers, aiming to enhance our accuracy and utility.
  </p>
<p>Impact Measurement: The pilot is also guiding our thinking on how to measure impact, ensuring that we can quantify the value Laptis delivers to both individuals and the broader community.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Accomplishments So Far:
  </p>
<p>Our biggest accomplishments are successfully connecting six clients with treatment and saving hours per day for each client’s respective attorney. We have found treatment for every client that has passed through our system – a few have chosen on their own not to go – and not all of the ten attorneys who are participating in the pilot have yet had clients that are appropriate fits for our services. Our lawyer partners have expressed huge gratitude for our services thus far – both in terms of saving them time and helping their clients find treatment – and all partners want to continue using us for as long as possible. 
</p>","<p>Our primary reason for applying to MIT Solve is to tap into its unparalleled network and foster relationships that can catalyze the growth and impact of Laptis. The Solve network – rich in diversity and expertise – can transform Laptis’ efforts along four major initiatives:</p>
<p>Access to partners and customers on all sides of the network: As we continue to execute our pilot, we aim to increase participation from both demand side and supply side entities over the coming months. Once we achieve sufficient demand side density, we will try to monetize our services with treatment centers, and B2B sales are best conducted through warm introductions or personal connections. The relationships fostered within the Solve community can open doors to new partnerships with law firms, hospitals, psychiatrists, and treatment centers. Even getting our feet in the door at a few of these entities will be crucial, as providing value to them will increase the industry virality of our platform. 
  </p>
<p>Access to technical talent: Solve’s network will be the best possible vehicle through which to build our software development team. MIT is a world-leader in technical innovation, and collaboration with Solve network talent will accelerate the development of our digital platform and matching algorithm.

Many of Solve’s experts and alumni have navigated these ecosystems firsthand, meaning they can provide invaluable guidance as we do the same. This will help us ensure our solution complies with healthcare regulations and data privacy laws, thereby protecting our clients and enhancing our credibility.
  </p>
<p>Mentorship around team management and measuring impact: Laptis will not be successful if the internal team and culture are not well-managed. Solve’s impressive entrepreneurial alumni that have “walked the walk” – along with Solve’s capacity workshops and leadership coaching – will offer insights into effectively managing early-stage teams. Additionally, building robust mechanisms for measuring and evaluating our impact is crucial. Solve’s support in building an impact measurement practice could be instrumental in quantifying our contributions to improving treatment outcomes.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In sum, our decision to apply to Solve is primarily driven by the strategic importance of network and relationship-building in reaching a number of our current objectives. Of course, Solve’s $10,000 grant, along with access to additional funding opportunities, would also be huge tailwinds in our early efforts, though this is not a major reason for our application.
</p>","Human Capital (e.g. sourcing talent, board development), Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact), Product / Service Distribution (e.g. delivery, logistics, expanding client base), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)",Andrew Steen,Yes,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Google or other search engine,"<p>To help Laptis tackle many of the challenges mentioned above (team building, finding advisors, building relationship with partners and customers, technical assistance, etc.), Andrew did a google search for social impact entrepreneurship support. Solve was one of the first links to appear alongside a few other accelerators, mentorship programs, and grants. 
</p>","<p>At its core, our solution reimagines the substance use treatment referral process, leveraging technology to streamline connections between and incentives among demand side entities and treatment centers. Laptis’ core innovations lie not just in our technology, but also in our strategies to address the inefficiencies and misalignment within the current substance use treatment landscape.</p>
<p>Our solution is immediately innovative in four main ways. 
  </p>
<p>End-to-End Network: Laptis is building a technology platform that runs end-to-end from treatment centers to demand side entities using a similar approach to AirBnb, UberEats, and Unite Us. This is an unprecedented strategy within the substance use treatment landscape, as most previous attempts have built one-sided static informational pages that provide limited value. Because Laptis delivers substantial benefits to all network stakeholders, this end-to-end approach will benefit from network effects which will in turn catalyze unforeseen platform innovations and growth opportunities in the future. 
  </p>
<p>Personalized Matching Algorithm: Unlike current referral systems that often rely on limited information and personal networks, Laptis is building a sophisticated algorithm designed to match clients with treatment options that best fit their specific needs, preferences, and circumstances. This personalized approach ensures a higher likelihood of treatment success, fundamentally changing how referrals are made and exponentially streamlining treatment centers’ ability to access clients. 
  </p>
<p>Comprehensive Treatment Center Database: Our solution features an extensive database of treatment centers that are detailed across over 30 dimensions such as treatment philosophy, insurance acceptance, and demographic qualifications. This depth of information – accessible through an intuitive digital platform – is unprecedented in the field and enables clients to make an informed choice about treatment while reducing the time required for demand side entities to identify suitable options.
  </p>
<p>Real-Time Availability and Updates: By providing real-time information on treatment center availability (in exchange for the customer acquisition value the platform confers on treatment centers), Laptis addresses one of the major bottlenecks in the referral process. This capability not only accelerates referrals, it also increases the efficiency of treatment centers in filling available spots, optimizing resource utilization across the board.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Additionally, Laptis can catalyze broader positive innovations within the substance use disorder treatment ecosystem and beyond. 
  </p>
<p>Facilitating Evidence-Based Practices: The data collected through our platform can contribute to research on treatment effectiveness, helping to promote evidence-based practices in substance use treatment. This can lead to more informed policy decisions and resource allocation in the long run.
  </p>
<p>Inspiring Technological Innovation: Generally speaking, the substance use treatment ecosystem does not operate at the cutting edge of technology. Laptis’ efforts to show how digital tools can solve complex problems will set a precedent for wider use of technology in addressing various challenges throughout many corners of substance use treatment.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In sum, Laptis’ innovative platform addresses a critical gap in the continuum of care and improves outcomes for all network stakeholders. This has the potential to fundamentally change the substance use treatment landscape by establishing a new standard for efficiency, transparency, and personalization. 
</p>","<p>Laptis' theory of change is grounded in the hypothesis that streamlined and efficient referral processes for substance use treatment can significantly improve access to care, enhance treatment outcomes, and ultimately contribute to broader public health and criminal justice benefits. In other words, our immediate goal is to streamline access to effective substance use treatment, and we believe this will improve treatment outcomes while reducing burdens on healthcare and criminal justice systems.</p>

  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Evidence Supporting our Theory of Change:
  </p>
<p>Our pilot partners have indicated high satisfaction with the efficiency and accuracy of our matching process, suggesting an improvement in the referral process and a reduced burden on criminal justice and healthcare professionals (they can spend more time on their professional specialties) (Supports O.1, OC.3).
  </p>
<p>Scholarly data and customer research indicate that personalized, data-driven approaches to substance use treatment are associated with higher retention rates and better health outcomes, reinforcing the importance of our matching algorithm (Supports OC.1).
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Assumptions:
  </p>
<p>Those seeking substance use treatment are hindered by the complexity of the current referral process to the point that it either prevents enrollment or results in poor matches. 
  </p>
<p>Treatment centers are willing and able to provide real-time data on their availability and accept referrals from our platform in exchange for the substantial customer acquisition benefits that we will provide. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Feedback Loops:
  </p>
<p>Feedback from users (both demand side entities and treatment centers) on the platform's effectiveness can lead to continuous improvements in the algorithm and database accuracy (A.1 ➞ O.1 ➞ OC.2/3 ➞ A.1).
</p>","<p>Laptis is committed to reducing addiction and transforming the substance use treatment landscape by improving the efficiency and efficacy of referrals. Our impact goals are designed to ensure that individuals struggling with substance use disorders (SUDs) have timely access to appropriate, high-quality treatment options. These goals align with several UN Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 3 (Healthy Lives and Wellbeing, because of reductions in addiction and SUD), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities, because our platform will benefit people from historically marginalized backgrounds). To track our progress, we employ numerous indicators that will signal the depth and breadth of our impact.</p>
<p>Impact Goals:
  </p>
<p>Reduce Addiction/Enhance Treatment Outcomes: Improve retention rates and success outcomes – and reduce relapse rates – for individuals referred through our platform.
  </p>
<p>Improve Access to SUD Treatment: Increase the number of individuals with SUDs who are matched with appropriate treatment options through our platform – especially those from historically marginalized or overlooked backgrounds. 
  </p>
<p>Reduce Burdens on Demand Side Entities: Reduce the time required for demand side professionals to find suitable treatment options for their clients, so they can spend more energy on their professional specialties. 
  </p>
<p>Reduce Healthcare Costs: Reduce both direct and indirect/downstream healthcare costs associated with SUDs by facilitating early and effective interventions in the form of connections to substance use treatment. 
  </p>
<p>Reduce Healthcare Inequalities: Ensure that all treatment-seeking clients can find appropriate options, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, and/or socio-economic status.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To measure our progress towards these goals, we are tracking several key indicators either passively through our software or actively through follow-ups with clients and users. We will compare this data to controls (either in the form of the non-Laptis population, or our partners’ numbers for a given statistic before they used Laptis) so we can understand our marginal impact.
  </p>
<p>Number and Type of Individuals Matched with Treatment: This indicator tracks the total number of individuals – as well as demographic information about these individuals – who have been matched with treatment options through our platform, directly reflecting our goal of improving access to SUD treatment and reducing healthcare inequality. 
  </p>
<p>Average Time to Find Suitable Treatment: By measuring the average time it takes for demand side professionals to find suitable treatment options using our platform, we can assess improvements in system efficiency and opportunity cost for their professional specialties. 
  </p>
<p>Retention Rate in Treatment Programs: Measured as the percentage of individuals who remain in treatment for the recommended duration, this indicator helps assess the quality and appropriateness of the matches made by our platform, indicating enhanced treatment outcomes.
  </p>
<p>Relapse Rates for Individuals on Our Platform: By anonymously measuring the number of individuals that come through our platform multiple times, we can understand how the rates of relapse for people referred through Laptis compared to that of the overall population. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By rigorously tracking these indicators, Laptis aims not only to measure our progress toward achieving our impact goals but also to continuously refine and improve our solution to ensure it has a transformative impact on people’s lives.
</p>","<p>The core technology behind Laptis is a cutting-edge platform that employs a variety of software, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and an extensive treatment center database to optimize substance use treatment referrals. By harnessing the power of these modern computational technologies, Laptis aims to streamline and personalize the connection between those seeking treatment and the most suitable care options available.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: At the forefront of our technology is an AI-driven matching algorithm. This algorithm is designed to intelligently process user data along with detailed treatment center information to identify the most appropriate care options. By leveraging ML techniques, the system continually learns and improves from each match it facilitates, enhancing the accuracy, efficacy, and personalization of recommendations over time. Furthermore, AI can be used to solve additional customer pain-points, such as rapid intake form completion (so demand side entities no longer have to fill out the same information multiple times on multiple forms) and client education (anything from inquiring about a specific treatment option to learning about how to de-stigmatize substance use disorder). 
  </p>
<p>Comprehensive Treatment Center Database: Supporting the AI component is a robust database that catalogues hundreds of treatment centers, each detailed in more than 30 dimensions. This database serves as the backbone of our platform, ensuring that our AI algorithms have a rich repository of data to draw from for making informed matching decisions. Because no comparably exhaustive database currently publicly exists, this is a key differentiator of the Laptis platform. 
  </p>
<p>Data Encryption and Security: Because Laptis will be transmitting sensitive information and PII, we are developing an end-to-end encryption system that protects user data from leaks or breaches.
  </p>
<p>Data Analysis: We can extract meaningful insights from the wealth of information collected through our platform to not only improve our matching algorithm, but also to diagnose trends across the treatment landscape. These trends can inform evidence-based practices and policy decisions not only for users of our platform, but also for policy decision-makers.
  </p>
<p>Software Architecture and User Experience Design: The software underpinning Laptis is developed with a keen focus on user experience (UX) and interface (UI) design, facilitating ease of use for both individuals seeking treatment and professionals. The platform's intuitive design allows users to effortlessly input their requirements, review their options, and proceed with informed decision-making, all within a few clicks.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In sum, Laptis' platform is a testament to how modern software and computational technologies can be utilized to make a substantial impact on the health and well-being of individuals dealing with substance use disorders.

  </p>
<p>Clients: those in need of treatment
  </p>
<p>Supply Side Entities: treatment centers
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Value Proposition:
  </p>
<p>For demand side entities, we save substantial time, allowing them to spend more energy on their professional specialties. For clients, we facilitate an informed treatment choice, improving treatment experiences and outcomes. For treatment centers, we offer access to a wider pool of potential clients, allowing them to acquire customers at unprecedented efficiency. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Partners + Key Stakeholders:
  </p>
<p>Boston-area demand side entities and treatment centers are crucial for our ability to access customers and test our solutions. 
  </p>
<p>Clients: we cannot overlook their needs and leave them behind.
  </p>
<p>Insurers: If we can prove that we are saving downstream medical costs, insurers can become great partners for implementation and monetization. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Channels:
  </p>
<p>Personal/Professional Networks: Our teammates’ and advisors’ networks are crucial for early traction. 
  </p>
<p>Outreach Programs: Engagement with professional communities through conferences, workshops, and webinars helps increase the top of the funnel and grow our brand. 
  </p>
<p>Private Bar Association: A group of 3,000+ lawyers in Massachusetts that take private and public cases and often refer clients to treatment. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cost Structure:
  </p>
<p>Personnel: Our team is and will continue to be our biggest financial cost – building a network takes a lot of coordination and testing, which requires people to execute.
  </p>
<p>Technology Development and Maintenance: To perform quickly and effectively, our software platform will require substantial investment.
  </p>
<p>Marketing and Outreach: Costs associated with promoting our platform to potential users and partners will likely grow over the next few years. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Surplus:
  </p>
<p>We do not expect to be profitable within the next twelve months, so revenue is reinvested into the three major cost structure topics.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Revenue:
  </p>
<p>Subscription Fees from Treatment Centers: Because we are facilitating efficient customer acquisition, a substantial subscription fee is justifiable.
  </p>
<p>Referral Fees for Insurers: Once we prove we are reducing downstream SUD costs, we can capture value from insurers when clients are successfully matched and admitted to treatment programs.
  </p>
<p>Premium Services: Advanced search and personalized support features will be available to high-budget clients and partners. 
</p>",Organizations (B2B),"<p>Laptis’ financial plan is that of a self-sustaining revenue model through recurring treatment center subscriptions, insurer referral fees, and potential contracts with healthcare systems and government bodies.</p>
<p>Revenue Streams:
  </p>
<p>Subscriptions from Treatment Centers: Treatment centers will pay a subscription fee in exchange for being listed on our platform and gaining access to our services and clients – this is effectively a marketing expense for them (and they already pay millions of dollars for such expenses). 
  </p>
<p>Insurer Referral Fees: We will capture a referral fee from insurers for each client successfully placed into a treatment program through our platform. To ensure mission alignment, a small fee will be captured after a successful client placement, and a larger fee will be captured after successful program completion. 
  </p>
<p>Premium Services for Demand Side Entities: While basic access to the platform is free for demand side entities, we will offer premium services such as enhanced search capabilities, additional client management tools, and dedicated support to both demand and supply side partners.
  </p>
<p>Government and Healthcare Contracts: We are exploring opportunities to contract directly with government bodies and healthcare systems that could benefit from streamlined access to treatment centers, reducing operational burdens and improving patient outcomes.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Evidence of Financial Success:
  </p>
<p>While Laptis has not yet captured revenue or grant money, there are still strong signs of promise for receiving income before the end of the summer. 
  </p>
<p>For one, many treatment centers have said they are willing to pay if we can get them the right mix of clients – as we continue to execute our pilot, we aim to charge treatment centers before September. However, aside from their words, the strongest evidence for their willingness to pay is in their actions: most treatment centers spend millions of dollars per year on marketing and referral resources because finding appropriate customers is difficult. A Laptis subscription would allow them to acquire customers far more efficiently than they currently do, and their willingness to pay for this is high based on current practices.
  </p>
<p>Additionally, insurers have also shown evidence of a willingness to pay for services that facilitate early interventions if the data is there. Companies like Upside that capture value from insurers for providing stable housing to at-risk populations are proof of this model, and Laptis has a sufficiently similar value proposition to insurers as Upside. 
  </p>
<p>Finally, Laptis qualifies for multiple NIAAA and NiDA SBIRs and STTRs, and we will apply for these in the coming weeks and months. We do not plan on raising equity capital for at least another 12 months – the reason for this is twofold: for one, we want to preserve ownership and mission alignment for as long as possible while we test early features. Second, we want to raise dilutive capital from a position of strength. We recognize the power and benefit that strong investment partners can have, and we want to explore such partnerships from as solid of a position as possible; customer revenue and grant money would put us there.

87379,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,A rapid-application EEG headband to improve the detection of status epilepticus in an at-home setting,"Philadelphia, PA, USA",United States,Not registered as any organization,,"<p>Status epilepticus is a dangerous medical condition that is incredibly difficult to detect outside of a medical setting.  According to Zack and Kobau (2017), approximately 470,000 children in the US were living with epilepsy as of 2015. These children could experience a seizure: a sudden spike in brain activity. Usually, a caretaker administers medication, and the seizure subsides, but for 5-7% of these children, their seizures don’t stop. It persists, or another follows quickly, leading to status epilepticus. An international review in 2023 found that status epilepticus is associated with a staggering 30% mortality rate. Status epilepticus occurs when a seizure exceeds five minutes or when multiple seizures strike within 5 minutes. Detecting it is crucial, yet profoundly challenging. Standard seizures are often noticeable due to convulsions, especially in the limbs. </p>
<p>But, in many cases of status epilepticus, the child’s body may be too exhausted to exhibit such movements. They may appear to be recovering when, in reality, they're in a critical state. These cases of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) can present with the only symptoms being an altered state of awareness or minimal signs like slight eyelid movement. It is incredibly difficult for caregivers to diagnose whether NCSE is occurring, or if the child is suffering from post-seizure lethargy. Without EEG monitoring, NCSE can easily go unnoticed, yet the risk of brain injury escalates the longer it continues. This is an even larger problem in low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization estimates that around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, and nearly 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>Currently, the only method to confirm status epilepticus is to describe the child's condition over the phone to a neurologist. The child may then be rushed to a hospital for EEG scans, which reveal brain activity irregularities. </p>
<p>Devices on the market today either focus on acceleration of the limbs, such as through accelerometer wristwatches, or use full EEG helmets for monitoring. The first is unable to detect NCSE since convulsions are not present. The second is unable to be used for at-home settings since the application is slow and requires a medical professional to gel and position the multitude of electrodes. This means that for a non-clinical setting, the best diagnostic technology is a phone call between a panicking caregiver and a distant physician. </p>
<p>A mortality rate of 30% for a condition that can easily be detected is inexcusable. This is the problem we have set out to solve. </p>

The flexible headband offers clinical-level seizure monitoring with 8 hospital-grade electrodes for at-home use.</p>
<p>The device is designed for short-term use following a seizure event. Once the visual signs of a convulsive seizure have stopped, a caretaker applies Epilog to the patient's head. EEG data is instantly recorded and fed into a machine-learning model to extract spectral features relevant to diagnosis. Finally, the caregiver will be alerted if the child is in a state of status epilepticus. After approximately 5-15 minutes have passed, the headband is removed and placed back into its casing for future use. </p>
<p>The rapid application is made possible through the use of a custom gel case. When not in use, Epilog rests wrapped in a ring inside a cylindrical case. The electrodes are positioned facing tubes radiating from the center, akin to spokes on a tire. Immediately before use, the gel is applied to a tube at the top, and the radiating tubes ensure that all electrodes on the headband are gelled simultaneously. This allows the device to be set up quickly by a caregiver and does not require expensive, low-fidelity dry electrodes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the electrodes on the headband are placed in adjustable brackets that can be locked into place. This means that the brackets can be adjusted as the child grows and for custom placement for different head shapes and sizes, but there is no risk of electrodes sliding out of place when locked and in use.</p>
<p>The data is collected by Ag/AgCl electrodes and is processed using hardware circuitry to amplify, denoise, and filter the signal. The signal from the 8 channels is then sent over Bluetooth to a smartphone, where the Epilog app (developed for both iOS and Android) accesses a custom machine learning model to detect whether status epilepticus is occurring. The data is first passed through a Discrete Wavelet Transform one second at a time to convert the data to the wavelet domain and obtain coefficients for various frequency bands. These coefficients are then passed into a Balanced Random Forest model, trained and tuned on the publicly available CHB-MIT dataset, to obtain the probability of a seizure occurring at every given second. The 8 channels are analyzed independently before aggregating and thresholding the resultant probability. If a seizure is detected, the application alerts the user and Epilog’s indicator light turns red. This detection algorithm can be fine-tuned for each individual user if needed, which is especially useful in patients with irregular EEG baselines. </p>
<p>Epilog is battery-powered by rechargeable 9V batteries and is a portable, lightweight solution, fitting in a 9” x 9” x 6” travel case, ensuring it can be used in a variety of environments. </p>

<p>First, the pediatric space for medical devices has been historically underdeveloped. Because of a lack of revenue and a significantly smaller market size, children often have to use medical devices designed for adults. These devices, such as a full EEG headcap, are often uncomfortable and provide inaccurate results. We recently attended the Pediatric Device Innovation Consortium (PDIC) in Minneapolis and found that many doctors were upset about the lack of EEG systems at the pediatric level. Epilog is designed with these pediatric patients in mind. The headband is made out of a flexible fabric and allows for adjustable electrode placements that can be moved and then locked into place. This ensures the device can be used for a variety of head shapes and sizes and even as the child grows. There are also a limited number of electrodes used to increase comfort and ease of use by an untrained caregiver since a full helmet is much more difficult and invasive than a headband. </p>
<p>Additionally, Epilog is designed for at-home use. This benefits everyone, but especially those who live far away from a hospital or cannot have reliable access to a pediatric neurologist. We have talked to a pediatric neurologist in a rural setting, who echoed that this is a major problem that hurts patient outcomes. When caretakers are unsure if their child has entered a state of status epilepticus or not, their best option is to rush to the hospital. However, many of these cases are false positives, as the symptoms of recovery often match the symptoms of status epilepticus. Having a device for at-home use reduces the need for these individuals to travel to a hospital, which is a key pain point. </p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that Epilog errs on the side of caution and prefers false positives (inversely related to specificity) to false negatives (inversely related to high sensitivity). Our algorithm metrics are a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.88, on par with products on the market today. This reflects a balance between ensuring that unnecessary hospital trips are reduced and that a child who needs care is not left without care. </p>","<p>Our development team reflects a diverse background that reflects the communities we are trying to serve. We have familiarity with medical device research and have worked in labs that directly target hospitals like the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Through this research, we have interacted directly with patients. Several members of our team are also heavily involved in the community, such as by volunteering at the HMS School for Children with Cerebral Palsy</p>
<p>For this project, we are also working closely with representatives who are close to our target communities. Our clinical mentor is Dr. Dennis Dlugos, a pediatric neurologist at CHOP. Since our planned pilot program will be at CHOP and at Philadelphia-area hospitals, working with these leaders is especially helpful. We are also working with Dr. Julie Karand from the University of Delaware, who started the Devices for the Developing World conference. She helps us ensure that we keep low-resource settings in mind by remaining battery-powered and therefore outlet-independent, reusable, and durable. </p>
<p>Our designs and implementation are heavily influenced by what Dr. Dlugos hears and sees when talking to his patients and their caregivers on a daily basis. The original idea for Epilog as a rapid-application, at-home device stemmed from these patient interactions. We hope to become more integrated into these parent groups and involve them in human factors testing to ensure that the target population is able to use and understand the device correctly. Through Solve, we hope to expand our close network beyond Philadelphia to make a nationwide impact with the same principles of patient- and caregiver-guided design.</p>","Ensure health-related data is collected ethically and effectively, and that AI and other insights are accurate, targeted, and actionable.","3. Good Health and Well-Being, 10. Reduced Inequalities",Prototype,"<p><em>W</em>e have built and tested our fully integrated prototype. The first part is the gel storage case that has been constructed out of acrylic and tubing and tested to ensure that a medically untrained user can properly apply it in under 15 seconds. Secondly, the elastic headband, complete with adjustable, lockable brackets, EEG electrodes, and postprocessing circuitry has been built and tested. The EEG signal quality was validated by visualizing the processed signal via Python and having the user blink, flutter their eyes, and close their eyes to see the Berger effect (a rise in alpha band magnitude when the eyes are closed). These effects were clear and easy to detect by a neurologist, our clinical mentor, who mentioned that the EEG collected by our headband and clinical-grade EEG were virtually indistinguishable. The signal-to-noise ratio of our device was also calculated to be around 25 dB among 5 test subjects and 20 trials each, which is on par with products like Emotiv that are currently on the market. </p>
<p>Thirdly, our machine learning algorithm was able to effectively classify seizure events with a specificity of 0.883 and sensitivity of 0.946 (ROC=0.95) on a testing dataset from CHB-MIT. Additionally, the average latency after a convulsive seizure event for 20 seconds of 100% correct prediction (status or not) was 26.77 seconds. We have also implemented fine-tuning on this algorithm by allowing patients to record their baseline (regular EEG, non-seizure) and use that to calibrate the weights of the model for each user. This improved performance on ROC (0.03), specificity (0.01), and sensitivity (0.05) for a specific patient who had irregular baselines in the CHB-MIT dataset. This algorithm was made available on a smartphone application that can be easily used and connected to Epilog via Bluetooth. The latency of the whole system was consistently under 1 second.</p>
<p>The entire prototype has been built. The headband can be gelled, put on a patient, and analyzed in under a minute. We have demonstrated this device to professors at the University of Pennsylvania in a non-seizure setting and simulated what would occur in a seizure setting by feeding in data from a seizure event from the CHB-MIT testing dataset. </p>

Epilog can accurately monitor EEG activity in real-time, providing a precise assessment of a child’s condition. This precision helps avoid unnecessary hospital communication and hospital visits, ensuring only critical cases lead to hospital admission. This drastically reduces hospital costs, especially for neurologists. In 2021, Ney, Gururangan, and Parvizi calculated that the use of EEG monitoring to detect non-convulsive seizures in hospitals saves $3,971 to $17,290 per use per patient. The same principle applies to at-home EEG monitoring. It is economically advisable for hospitals to keep Epilog on hand and hand it out to patients who may need it. Our clinical advisor at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia has mentioned that he would recommend at-home EEG monitoring to all his patients, to ensure both data-driven decision-making and fewer hospital visits. </p>
<p>This is a similar business plan to Ceribell, an EEG-monitoring system designed for hospital use. Epilog is meant to be a rapid application variant of this technology, meant to be applied and removed after a seizure event at home. However, the impact of reducing hospital costs still applies and we are confident that hospitals will be incentivized to purchase devices like Epilog to give to their patients. </p>

 What specific problem are you solving?: Status epilepticus is a dangerous medical condition that is incredibly difficult to detect outside of a medical setting.  According to Zack and Kobau (2017), approximately 470,000 children in the US were living with epilepsy as of 2015. These children could experience a seizure: a sudden spike in brain activity. Usually, a caretaker administers medication, and the seizure subsides, but for 5-7% of these children, their seizures don’t stop. It persists, or another follows quickly, leading to status epilepticus. An international review in 2023 found that status epilepticus is associated with a staggering 30% mortality rate. Status epilepticus occurs when a seizure exceeds five minutes or when multiple seizures strike within 5 minutes. Detecting it is crucial, yet profoundly challenging. Standard seizures are often noticeable due to convulsions, especially in the limbs. 
But, in many cases of status epilepticus, the child’s body may be too exhausted to exhibit such movements. They may appear to be recovering when, in reality, they're in a critical state. These cases of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) can present with the only symptoms being an altered state of awareness or minimal signs like slight eyelid movement. It is incredibly difficult for caregivers to diagnose whether NCSE is occurring, or if the child is suffering from post-seizure lethargy. Without EEG monitoring, NCSE can easily go unnoticed, yet the risk of brain injury escalates the longer it continues. This is an even larger problem in low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization estimates that around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, and nearly 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries.
Currently, the only method to confirm status epilepticus is to describe the child's condition over the phone to a neurologist. The child may then be rushed to a hospital for EEG scans, which reveal brain activity irregularities. 
Devices on the market today either focus on acceleration of the limbs, such as through accelerometer wristwatches, or use full EEG helmets for monitoring. The first is unable to detect NCSE since convulsions are not present. The second is unable to be used for at-home settings since the application is slow and requires a medical professional to gel and position the multitude of electrodes. This means that for a non-clinical setting, the best diagnostic technology is a phone call between a panicking caregiver and a distant physician. 
A mortality rate of 30% for a condition that can easily be detected is inexcusable. This is the problem we have set out to solve.

 What is your solution?: Epilog is a rapid-application EEG headband designed to help caretakers of epilepsy patients make data-driven decisions. The flexible headband offers clinical-level seizure monitoring with 8 hospital-grade electrodes for at-home use.
The device is designed for short-term use following a seizure event. Once the visual signs of a convulsive seizure have stopped, a caretaker applies Epilog to the patient's head. EEG data is instantly recorded and fed into a machine-learning model to extract spectral features relevant to diagnosis. Finally, the caregiver will be alerted if the child is in a state of status epilepticus. After approximately 5-15 minutes have passed, the headband is removed and placed back into its casing for future use. 
The rapid application is made possible through the use of a custom gel case. When not in use, Epilog rests wrapped in a ring inside a cylindrical case. The electrodes are positioned facing tubes radiating from the center, akin to spokes on a tire. Immediately before use, the gel is applied to a tube at the top, and the radiating tubes ensure that all electrodes on the headband are gelled simultaneously. This allows the device to be set up quickly by a caregiver and does not require expensive, low-fidelity dry electrodes.
Additionally, the electrodes on the headband are placed in adjustable brackets that can be locked into place. This means that the brackets can be adjusted as the child grows and for custom placement for different head shapes and sizes, but there is no risk of electrodes sliding out of place when locked and in use.
The data is collected by Ag/AgCl electrodes and is processed using hardware circuitry to amplify, denoise, and filter the signal. The signal from the 8 channels is then sent over Bluetooth to a smartphone, where the Epilog app (developed for both iOS and Android) accesses a custom machine learning model to detect whether status epilepticus is occurring. The data is first passed through a Discrete Wavelet Transform one second at a time to convert the data to the wavelet domain and obtain coefficients for various frequency bands. These coefficients are then passed into a Balanced Random Forest model, trained and tuned on the publicly available CHB-MIT dataset, to obtain the probability of a seizure occurring at every given second. The 8 channels are analyzed independently before aggregating and thresholding the resultant probability. If a seizure is detected, the application alerts the user and Epilog’s indicator light turns red. This detection algorithm can be fine-tuned for each individual user if needed, which is especially useful in patients with irregular EEG baselines. 
Epilog is battery-powered by rechargeable 9V batteries and is a portable, lightweight solution, fitting in a 9” x 9” x 6” travel case, ensuring it can be used in a variety of environments.

 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : The solution is designed to serve children with epilepsy, especially those without reliable, 24/7 access to a neurology clinic. 
First, the pediatric space for medical devices has been historically underdeveloped. Because of a lack of revenue and a significantly smaller market size, children often have to use medical devices designed for adults. These devices, such as a full EEG headcap, are often uncomfortable and provide inaccurate results. We recently attended the Pediatric Device Innovation Consortium (PDIC) in Minneapolis and found that many doctors were upset about the lack of EEG systems at the pediatric level. Epilog is designed with these pediatric patients in mind. The headband is made out of a flexible fabric and allows for adjustable electrode placements that can be moved and then locked into place. This ensures the device can be used for a variety of head shapes and sizes and even as the child grows. There are also a limited number of electrodes used to increase comfort and ease of use by an untrained caregiver since a full helmet is much more difficult and invasive than a headband. 
Additionally, Epilog is designed for at-home use. This benefits everyone, but especially those who live far away from a hospital or cannot have reliable access to a pediatric neurologist. We have talked to a pediatric neurologist in a rural setting, who echoed that this is a major problem that hurts patient outcomes. When caretakers are unsure if their child has entered a state of status epilepticus or not, their best option is to rush to the hospital. However, many of these cases are false positives, as the symptoms of recovery often match the symptoms of status epilepticus. Having a device for at-home use reduces the need for these individuals to travel to a hospital, which is a key pain point. 
It is important to note, though, that Epilog errs on the side of caution and prefers false positives (inversely related to specificity) to false negatives (inversely related to high sensitivity). Our algorithm metrics are a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.88, on par with products on the market today. This reflects a balance between ensuring that unnecessary hospital trips are reduced and that a child who needs care is not left without care. 
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: Our development team reflects a diverse background that reflects the communities we are trying to serve. We have familiarity with medical device research and have worked in labs that directly target hospitals like the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Through this research, we have interacted directly with patients. Several members of our team are also heavily involved in the community, such as by volunteering at the HMS School for Children with Cerebral Palsy
For this project, we are also working closely with representatives who are close to our target communities. Our clinical mentor is Dr. Dennis Dlugos, a pediatric neurologist at CHOP. Since our planned pilot program will be at CHOP and at Philadelphia-area hospitals, working with these leaders is especially helpful. We are also working with Dr. Julie Karand from the University of Delaware, who started the Devices for the Developing World conference. She helps us ensure that we keep low-resource settings in mind by remaining battery-powered and therefore outlet-independent, reusable, and durable. 
Our designs and implementation are heavily influenced by what Dr. Dlugos hears and sees when talking to his patients and their caregivers on a daily basis. The original idea for Epilog as a rapid-application, at-home device stemmed from these patient interactions. We hope to become more integrated into these parent groups and involve them in human factors testing to ensure that the target population is able to use and understand the device correctly. Through Solve, we hope to expand our close network beyond Philadelphia to make a nationwide impact with the same principles of patient- and caregiver-guided design.
 Which dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address?: Ensure health-related data is collected ethically and effectively, and that AI and other insights are accurate, targeted, and actionable.
 Which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals does your solution address?: 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 10. Reduced Inequalities
 What is your solution’s stage of development?: Prototype
 Please share details about why you selected the stage above.: We have built and tested our fully integrated prototype. The first part is the gel storage case that has been constructed out of acrylic and tubing and tested to ensure that a medically untrained user can properly apply it in under 15 seconds. Secondly, the elastic headband, complete with adjustable, lockable brackets, EEG electrodes, and postprocessing circuitry has been built and tested. The EEG signal quality was validated by visualizing the processed signal via Python and having the user blink, flutter their eyes, and close their eyes to see the Berger effect (a rise in alpha band magnitude when the eyes are closed). These effects were clear and easy to detect by a neurologist, our clinical mentor, who mentioned that the EEG collected by our headband and clinical-grade EEG were virtually indistinguishable. The signal-to-noise ratio of our device was also calculated to be around 25 dB among 5 test subjects and 20 trials each, which is on par with products like Emotiv that are currently on the market. 
Thirdly, our machine learning algorithm was able to effectively classify seizure events with a specificity of 0.883 and sensitivity of 0.946 (ROC=0.95) on a testing dataset from CHB-MIT. Additionally, the average latency after a convulsive seizure event for 20 seconds of 100% correct prediction (status or not) was 26.77 seconds. We have also implemented fine-tuning on this algorithm by allowing patients to record their baseline (regular EEG, non-seizure) and use that to calibrate the weights of the model for each user. This improved performance on ROC (0.03), specificity (0.01), and sensitivity (0.05) for a specific patient who had irregular baselines in the CHB-MIT dataset. This algorithm was made available on a smartphone application that can be easily used and connected to Epilog via Bluetooth. The latency of the whole system was consistently under 1 second.
The entire prototype has been built. The headband can be gelled, put on a patient, and analyzed in under a minute. We have demonstrated this device to professors at the University of Pennsylvania in a non-seizure setting and simulated what would occur in a seizure setting by feeding in data from a seizure event from the CHB-MIT testing dataset. 
We have also filed a provisional utility patent focusing on the rapid application of our headband through the use of a gel case and flexible headband.

The primary factor that we hope to reduce is to reduce the mortality rate of patients that use Epilog by a significant margin. This is a difficult statistic to measure, though, and before we roll it out to customers, it is impossible to calculate. Therefore, we have several intermediate impact goals in mind. The first is improving caregiver peace of mind. This can be measured qualitatively through surveys of caregivers regarding Epilog as a concept and then after providing them with a functional device. It can also be measured in the reduction of communication between caregivers and pediatric neurologists post-seizure to diagnose status epilepticus, since these medical professionals are often quite busy and many of these calls/visits are false positives.

 In which countries do you currently operate?: United States
 Which, if any, additional countries will you be operating in within the next year?: nan
 How many people work on your solution team?: 5 full-time engineers are working on this solution.
 How long have you been working on your solution? : We have worked on this project for approximately 1 year (starting in June 2023).
 Tell us about how you ensure that your team is diverse, minimizes barriers to opportunity for staff, and provides a welcoming and inclusive environment for all team members.: Our team of 5 individuals is incredibly diverse, representing broad backgrounds. Ethnically, team members are from Brazil, India, China, and the United States. Additionally, there are a total of 6 different languages spoken between us, ensuring that communication is possible with a variety of target audiences. There are also 4 women on the team to advocate for and support women in STEM. In the future, as our team expands, we hope to keep DEI practices in mind by ensuring voices from all sides of the conversation are heard and integrated. 
Through the support of the University of Pennsylvania, equity is maintained. Our working space, the George H. Stephenson Foundation Educational Laboratory &amp; Bio-MakerSpace, is open to everyone and provides resources equitably to ensure that all of us have all the tools necessary to thrive. Additionally, our team practices inclusion and equity by ensuring that more than one person is in charge of a certain task to ensure that no one is singled out. This also has the added benefit of having a partner to springboard ideas off of and has helped us stay on track through the development process. 
Our team environment is incredibly transparent and we practice good communication strategies, such as by having an open mind at all times and hosting weekly in-person meetings to plan for the week ahead and air out any grievances, if any. 
Our group also regularly engages with community organizations to stay involved in the Philadelphia community, both academically/medically and otherwise. This helps us keep in touch with users outside of the so-called “Penn bubble” that students find themselves in. As we expand, we hope to include more community leaders in the areas we target, to ensure that we maintain DEI principles and to enhance the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups. 
Through our training at Penn (ethics, anthropology, history, and other courses in social science)  as well as resources like the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI) at Penn, we hope to continue having a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment moving forward. 
 What is your business model?: Our business model is to focus on pediatric neurology clinics. Epilog can accurately monitor EEG activity in real-time, providing a precise assessment of a child’s condition. This precision helps avoid unnecessary hospital communication and hospital visits, ensuring only critical cases lead to hospital admission. This drastically reduces hospital costs, especially for neurologists. In 2021, Ney, Gururangan, and Parvizi calculated that the use of EEG monitoring to detect non-convulsive seizures in hospitals saves $3,971 to $17,290 per use per patient. The same principle applies to at-home EEG monitoring. It is economically advisable for hospitals to keep Epilog on hand and hand it out to patients who may need it. Our clinical advisor at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia has mentioned that he would recommend at-home EEG monitoring to all his patients, to ensure both data-driven decision-making and fewer hospital visits. 
This is a similar business plan to Ceribell, an EEG-monitoring system designed for hospital use. Epilog is meant to be a rapid application variant of this technology, meant to be applied and removed after a seizure event at home. However, the impact of reducing hospital costs still applies and we are confident that hospitals will be incentivized to purchase devices like Epilog to give to their patients.

 Do you primarily provide products or services directly to individuals, to other organizations, or to the government?: Organizations (B2B)
 What is your plan for becoming financially sustainable, and what evidence can you provide that this plan has been successful so far?: Currently, we have received approximately $1500 in funding from the University of Pennsylvania Bioengineering Department. Our funding approach moving forward is to use resources from the University of Pennsylvania, such as the Detkin IP and Technology Legal Clinic, and non-dilutive competition funding over the next couple of months as we move forward in securing IP protection and human factors testing. After that, we plan to raise investment capital from angel and seed investors to sustain operations as we focus on the manufacturability of our device and draft a 510(k) approval application (using codes OMC and OLT and with PCCP, Predetermined Change Control Plans for Machine Learning-Enabled Medical Devices). Once approval has been granted, we plan to roll out a pilot program at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), as we have secured clinical interest from pediatric neurologists there. This is where the first revenue streams begin, and we are targeting neurology clinics as a point of sale. We do not calculate that we will be profitable at this point yet, and will rely on investor funding and likely open a Series A round. Following a pilot program at CHOP, we will incorporate the resulting feedback and start rolling out to local Philadelphia-area clinics. Since the team is based in Philadelphia, this will make distribution and supply chain logistics easier. We plan to slowly increase the distribution to other metropolitan areas on the East Coast and eventually throughout the East Coast. This is when we project profitability to first occur. Eventually, we hope to expand across the United States. We also plan to concurrently work on international approval pipelines to extend internationally and start to help the millions worldwide who suffer from pediatric seizures. 
Additionally, we also foresee potential business partnerships or acquisition opportunities from Ceribell and other EEG monitoring devices. Since our rapid-application, at-home technologies complement their hospital use, we do not wish to compete with these companies but rather work together to ensure that EEG monitoring becomes commonplace in all settings.","The solution provided by the team is comprehensive, well-detailed, and addresses a significant gap in the healthcare system for children with epilepsy, particularly those at risk of status epilepticus.

Simultaneously, the project aims to surpass a fundraising goal of $4000, showcasing financial viability and community support. Building a effective operational team comprising at least 15 dedicated individuals which we will recruit from the homeless shelter to provide employement opportunities. Official correspondence with the government along with securing funds and official support from the government. Successfully negotiating with delivery companies for free services in exchange for CSR points. Onboarding 15 or more restaurants and homeless shelter owners as active contributors for partnership.

 Why are you applying to Solve?: I have studied that the current applications are neither efficient nor successful and less than a thousand downloads is a testament to this fact. Thus, leveraging my inventiveness, I would even pitch this to the government to launch a more comprehensive and expansive app for all platforms or modify an already existing one with more secure features being implemented in government-operated applications (eg., Rain Basera). This can initially cover only the homeless shelter in the Delhi religion, and then gradually expand its data and analyses. Moreover, it has to be ensured that the mobile application is user-friendly and addresses the lags by keeping it properly monitored and optimising the code, image, UI rendering, and resources. This will make it the first of its kind in the market. 
Unique Value Proposition - Users can easily locate the nearest homeless shelters, check the live availability of resources like beds and meals, and will be awarded for assisting homeless people to shelters. Surplus food from nearby restaurants or residents will be collected for free.
Sustainable Advantage - It is a non-profit business, so we have persuaded the government of India to fund our project, making it challenging for others to replicate. Furthering our good relations with NGOs will provide us additional support.
CSR opportunity  - Companies can come forward and take responsibility of the homeless shelters and try to parallelly maintain them which till now have only been handled by government directly or NGO. By this, it would be blessing in disguise by the corporates as they will gain their CSR points. The companies who will participate will be benefitted in numerous ways like better brand recognition, positive business reputation, tax benefits, easier access to capital and organisational growth.

Revenue Streams - Government subsidies, NGO assistance, and partnerships with delivery companies offering discounted services (to fulfil their CSR) will be our revenue sources.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: While there is already an existing mobile app called “Rain Basera,” it is not available on many platforms, like iOS and Android. low impact is visible from the less than a thousand downloads that it has had over its name since its inception in the year 2018. My app is highly ambitious and covers all the shortcomings. My app will have many features that will make it more efficient and, in turn, solve more problems. As the ""Rain Basera” app only provides the users with the location of the homeless shelters near them, mine will also inform them about the availability of beds, food supplies, medication, and so much more. The specific geographical jurisdiction for this app initially will be Delhi. It can be expanded later. It will bring urban transformation and rejuvenation. If it’s a great start in Delhi, then this is also going to set a precedent for other states and will altogether help in working towards the fairness and development of society.
Using precious resources in the correct manner would automatically contribute to better health for homeless people, as they will have access to food and a good place to sleep, as most of the homeless suffer from malnutrition and diseases caused by being exposed to the harsh environment as they do not have any place to live.
Furthermore, I also plan on creating secure closed-circuit cameras, monitoring, taped video, and phone operations with fair discussion and talks with the local authority and the responsible government. Great brand-building opportunity for companies to gain CSR points, which in turn would not only help us track the homeless but also reduce crimes significantly.
I am motivated to work on this project for the betterment of society. My purpose in bridging such gaps in society is to help decrease inequality and provide a more inclusive community with a hopeful future for everyone. Solving problems that are limiting people's potential and happiness is a way to achieve fairness in our society while also progressing toward overall welfare and development.
Homehope helps in uniting students who wish to contribute to the project. The noble aim of homehome motivates other students to join this project and put in their efforts for its success. This project instils a sense of gratitude in students to give back to the society as a sign of gratefulness for the privileges they possess. It brings a social change in the society which positively impacts the fairness and development of the society. The project helps the student body to use their learning from the academics to effectively use it in the practical and real life scenarios through his project. Therefore, this support and collective efforts, along with community and educational backing, can contribute to the impactful success of HomeHope in addressing homelessness and societal change. His goal is not just a successful launch in Delhi but to set a precedent for other states, contributing to the fairness and development of society.

 What are your impact goals for your solution and how are you measuring your progress towards them?: In the pursuit of HomeHope's success, several key milestones have been identified to guide its impact and growth. The first milestone involves achieving a substantial user base, with a target of 2500 or more downloads of the HomeHope app, monitored through app store metrics and user engagement data. Simultaneously, the project aims to surpass a fundraising goal of $4000, showcasing financial viability and community support. Building a effective operational team comprising at least 15 dedicated individuals which we will recruit from the homeless shelter to provide employement opportunities. Official correspondence with the government along with securing funds and official support from the government. Successfully negotiating with delivery companies for free services in exchange for CSR points. Onboarding 15 or more restaurants and homeless shelter owners as active contributors for partnership. Providing meals to more than 100,000 homeless individuals. More than 100,000 users locating and assisting homeless individuals using the app which can be documented from reports of successful assistance. 
He has involved many students from his school who possess different expertise to contribute to bring forth fresh ideas which are practical and efficient. His collaboration with the governmenet helps him generate credibility for his project and making it trust worthy for the other students' efforts. He has hosted numerous bake sales like during christmas carnivals in his school and outside his school by persuading the students to help in promoting such noble cause. Gradually the participation of students getting involved in his project are increasing as many people can correlate with the plight faced by the homeless. He has performed testing of his app HomeHope with surveys from students at his school, Pathways School Gurgaon, reflects the engagement from his school community.This approach showcased my analytical, creative, and persuasive skills. Additionally, he has proposed an innovative app to optimize resource allocation, demonstrating his ability to think outside the box. He did not take emotional decision instead analysed various aspects like economic and social to take a calculative decision without any bias. He is deeply committed to improving his skills and enhancing his knowledge. His problem-solving skills, coupled with effective communication abilities, set him apart.

 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: Geolocation Services: To locate nearby homeless shelters, the app would use geolocation services such as GPS and mapping APIs (e.g., Google Maps API) to help users find shelters and resources like beds and meals.
Real-time Database: For checking the availability of resources, a real-time database would be required. Firebase Realtime Database or a similar cloud-hosted database could provide live updates of the availability of beds and meals.

Award System: An internal logic and database to track individual contributions and issue awards would be needed. This could be a simple point tracking system with thresholds to trigger the award.

Food Surplus Notification System: Restaurants and residents could use a form within the app to notify about surplus food. This would likely be part of the app's backend, which could be built on a serverless platform like AWS Lambda for handling asynchronous requests.

Food Preservation and Delivery Tracking: IoT-enabled cooling boxes with GPS tracking and temperature monitoring could ensure the food is kept at a safe temperature. APIs to interface with the hardware for live updates of temperature and location would be part of this solution.

Booking and Donation Features: Integration with payment gateways (like Stripe or PayPal) for financial transactions to reserve shelter spaces or make donations. The app would also need a booking system to manage space reservations.

87825,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,We have created a compact and resource-saving design for pre-filled syringes for use throughout the healthcare industry.,"Homestead, PA, USA",United States,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>In rural and low-resource settings around the world, the physical aspect of delivering healthcare services is incredibly challenging. Telehealth, mobile health applications, and AI-powered diagnostic algorithms can fill some of the gaps related to assessing and diagnosing patients in these settings. That is not the end of the patient's experience though - now they need to receive and access the physical treatment needed for their condition. This often means the patient needs intravenous therapy to receive fluids, medication, or blood. This is such a common part of healthcare that over 90% of hospitalized patients receive an IV as part of their treatment. To administer these types of treatment, you need easy-to-use, safe, affordable, and effective physical healthcare products such as syringes, needles, fluids, and medications.</p>
<p>In high-resource settings, pre-filled syringes have grown dramatically in demand for the purpose of delivering such physical healthcare treatments - from starting IVs to delivering injectable medications and even providing vaccines. Their popularity is due to their convenience, ease of use, safety benefits for patients and providers alike, and clinical outcomes. In fact, over 7 billion pre-filled syringes are used around the world each year and the 8 billion dollar market for them continues to grow by 10% each year. Unfortunately, because the current design for pre-filled syringes is not optimized and designed for the complex and elongated supply chains experienced in fragile settings, they waste significant space, resources, effort, and money in the shipping and storing processes. Therefore, pre-filled syringe technology is inaccessible in many rural and low-resource settings around the world.</p>
<p>Major companies have a blind spot in these developing markets because the current design is not optimized, leaving large populations without access to pre-filled syringes. The alternative to pre-filled syringes is drawing up solutions from vials, which can lead to cross-contamination, accidental needle sticks, wasted medication, wasted supplies, delayed medication administration, and/or inaccurate dosing. These challenges can put the health and safety of both patients and providers at risk. The status quo leaves those in low-resource contexts who could benefit from fast physical treatment delivery, reduced healthcare-acquired infections, and even at-home self-treatment, without this beneficial technology. Pacto Medical is solving this inequitable situation through our SlimShot Syringe.</p>","<p>We have invented a collapsible syringe with a 40% smaller packaging footprint relative to traditional pre-filled syringes. This was done by redesigning the plunger rod and assembly and nesting it alongside the syringe barrel. During transport, the syringe barrel and plunger rod assembly remain compactly attached to one another. When it is ready for use, the user can easily detach the plunger rod from the syringe barrel and reassemble the plunger rod with a quick and easy snap-fit into where it is traditionally attached. </p>
<p>Due to our 40% smaller packaging footprint, we can fit 7,000 more pre-filled syringes on each pallet than the current design can. This leads to significant reductions in cost when it comes to sterilization processing, shipping, and storage, and last-mile distribution. We have estimated that our solution results in a minimum reduction in transport costs of 35%. In addition, our solution saves 5 cents per syringe on packaging, 17 cents per syringe in cases where e-beam sterilization is used, and $3.30 per syringe in cases when cold shipping is used. In the case of remote contexts where the place of manufacturing is often even further away from the point of use, these savings in transport costs are magnified even further. This means that the providers and patients at the end of the supply chain can access the benefits of pre-filled syringe technology for a more affordable amount.</p>
<p>Due to the smaller packaging footprint, our solution also reduces the carbon footprint of shipping these medical products around the world. To demonstrate this, think of the current number of pre-filled syringes used around the world being shipped across the Atlantic in the current form versus the SlimShot Syringe form. In this case, the SlimShot Syringe form would use 14,000 fewer 40ft shipping containers and emit far less carbon in the process. In fact, using the SlimShot Syringe form for that trip alone would save the equivalent of planting over 5,100 football fields of forests. </p>
<p>Overall, our design saves supply chain costs, reduces environmental impact, and makes it easier to get more pre-filled syringes to more patients around the world. This is especially the case in fragile, complex, low-resource, and emergency settings where supply chain challenges, costs, and bottlenecks are abundant and resources such as transport, staff, and funds are low.</p>","<p>Patient: These patients live in fragile, complex, disaster, rural, and/or low-resource settings where access to physical healthcare products and services is extremely limited, expensive, and unreliable. They have minimal or no funds to pay for out-of-pocket healthcare costs, need their treatment to be delivered safely and quickly, and cannot afford to deal with the costs or challenges associated with HCAIs. For these patients, the SlimShot Syringe offers high-quality pre-filled syringes and products often needed for their treatment at a reduced cost. These pre-filled syringes are also available more often due to their reduced cost for the procuring groups and because each box now carries far more doses so there are fewer supply chain backlogs and bottlenecks. These pre-filled syringes also deliver these patients safer and more sterile treatment compared to the alternative of a healthcare provider drawing up doses of medication or solution from a vial outside of a sterile manufacturing plant. This means the patient will experience fewer HCAIs. In some cases, patients may be trained to take extra injections home so they can administer their treatment at home. This is because injecting with a pre-filled syringe is easier and does not require much training. For the patient, this would mean more time at home to take care of other needs.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals: Like their patients, many of these professionals live and work in fragile, complex, disaster, rural, and/or low-resource settings where access to physical healthcare products and services is extremely limited, expensive, and unreliable. There are often few such healthcare professionals so their time, health, and safety is especially important and they must be able to see and treat astounding numbers of patients each day to keep up with the demand. For these healthcare providers, the SlimShot Syringe allows them to have greater access to more pre-filled syringes. Such syringes make delivering treatment faster, easier, and more convenient, saving them time and frustration when compared to the vial method. In addition, as pre-filled syringes avoid the step of drawing up solution from a vial, there is reduced interaction with needles per medication administration, which reduces the chance of accidental needle sticks and occupational injuries for these providers. With the SlimShot Syringe, these providers can deliver better quality care that is faster, easier, more convenient, more precise, and safer for all involved.</p>
<p>Payer (healthcare org, government, or humanitarian org): These funding and procuring organizations are varied in type, but all experience limited budgets and are working to provide the most and best care for the least amount of money. The SlimShot Syringe allows them to stretch their budgets further while offering them access to pre-filled syringe technology and improved associated care and patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Planet: This group encompasses everyone living on our planet, but especially those living in low-resource settings who are disproportionately negatively impacted by climate change. For them, we offer a solution that allows healthcare delivery to improve and continue, but with a significantly reduced environmental footprint.</p>","<p>Current syringe manufacturers and suppliers are not incentivized to optimize products for low-resource settings or fragile contexts as this work is challenging, time-consuming, and needs to be done with and in these communities. As the design for commercially available pre-filled syringes has remained stagnant for far too long, it is clear that a passionate and grounded team from outside of the commercial sector is needed to create and propel a feasible solution for these challenges.</p>

 What specific problem are you solving?: In rural and low-resource settings around the world, the physical aspect of delivering healthcare services is incredibly challenging. Telehealth, mobile health applications, and AI-powered diagnostic algorithms can fill some of the gaps related to assessing and diagnosing patients in these settings. That is not the end of the patient's experience though - now they need to receive and access the physical treatment needed for their condition. This often means the patient needs intravenous therapy to receive fluids, medication, or blood. This is such a common part of healthcare that over 90% of hospitalized patients receive an IV as part of their treatment. To administer these types of treatment, you need easy-to-use, safe, affordable, and effective physical healthcare products such as syringes, needles, fluids, and medications.
In high-resource settings, pre-filled syringes have grown dramatically in demand for the purpose of delivering such physical healthcare treatments - from starting IVs to delivering injectable medications and even providing vaccines. Their popularity is due to their convenience, ease of use, safety benefits for patients and providers alike, and clinical outcomes. In fact, over 7 billion pre-filled syringes are used around the world each year and the 8 billion dollar market for them continues to grow by 10% each year. Unfortunately, because the current design for pre-filled syringes is not optimized and designed for the complex and elongated supply chains experienced in fragile settings, they waste significant space, resources, effort, and money in the shipping and storing processes. Therefore, pre-filled syringe technology is inaccessible in many rural and low-resource settings around the world.
Major companies have a blind spot in these developing markets because the current design is not optimized, leaving large populations without access to pre-filled syringes. The alternative to pre-filled syringes is drawing up solutions from vials, which can lead to cross-contamination, accidental needle sticks, wasted medication, wasted supplies, delayed medication administration, and/or inaccurate dosing. These challenges can put the health and safety of both patients and providers at risk. The status quo leaves those in low-resource contexts who could benefit from fast physical treatment delivery, reduced healthcare-acquired infections, and even at-home self-treatment, without this beneficial technology. Pacto Medical is solving this inequitable situation through our SlimShot Syringe.
 What is your solution?: We have invented a collapsible syringe with a 40% smaller packaging footprint relative to traditional pre-filled syringes. This was done by redesigning the plunger rod and assembly and nesting it alongside the syringe barrel. During transport, the syringe barrel and plunger rod assembly remain compactly attached to one another. When it is ready for use, the user can easily detach the plunger rod from the syringe barrel and reassemble the plunger rod with a quick and easy snap-fit into where it is traditionally attached. 
Due to our 40% smaller packaging footprint, we can fit 7,000 more pre-filled syringes on each pallet than the current design can. This leads to significant reductions in cost when it comes to sterilization processing, shipping, and storage, and last-mile distribution. We have estimated that our solution results in a minimum reduction in transport costs of 35%. In addition, our solution saves 5 cents per syringe on packaging, 17 cents per syringe in cases where e-beam sterilization is used, and $3.30 per syringe in cases when cold shipping is used. In the case of remote contexts where the place of manufacturing is often even further away from the point of use, these savings in transport costs are magnified even further. This means that the providers and patients at the end of the supply chain can access the benefits of pre-filled syringe technology for a more affordable amount.
Due to the smaller packaging footprint, our solution also reduces the carbon footprint of shipping these medical products around the world. To demonstrate this, think of the current number of pre-filled syringes used around the world being shipped across the Atlantic in the current form versus the SlimShot Syringe form. In this case, the SlimShot Syringe form would use 14,000 fewer 40ft shipping containers and emit far less carbon in the process. In fact, using the SlimShot Syringe form for that trip alone would save the equivalent of planting over 5,100 football fields of forests. 
Overall, our design saves supply chain costs, reduces environmental impact, and makes it easier to get more pre-filled syringes to more patients around the world. This is especially the case in fragile, complex, low-resource, and emergency settings where supply chain challenges, costs, and bottlenecks are abundant and resources such as transport, staff, and funds are low.
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : Patient: These patients live in fragile, complex, disaster, rural, and/or low-resource settings where access to physical healthcare products and services is extremely limited, expensive, and unreliable. They have minimal or no funds to pay for out-of-pocket healthcare costs, need their treatment to be delivered safely and quickly, and cannot afford to deal with the costs or challenges associated with HCAIs. For these patients, the SlimShot Syringe offers high-quality pre-filled syringes and products often needed for their treatment at a reduced cost. These pre-filled syringes are also available more often due to their reduced cost for the procuring groups and because each box now carries far more doses so there are fewer supply chain backlogs and bottlenecks. These pre-filled syringes also deliver these patients safer and more sterile treatment compared to the alternative of a healthcare provider drawing up doses of medication or solution from a vial outside of a sterile manufacturing plant. This means the patient will experience fewer HCAIs. In some cases, patients may be trained to take extra injections home so they can administer their treatment at home. This is because injecting with a pre-filled syringe is easier and does not require much training. For the patient, this would mean more time at home to take care of other needs.
Healthcare professionals: Like their patients, many of these professionals live and work in fragile, complex, disaster, rural, and/or low-resource settings where access to physical healthcare products and services is extremely limited, expensive, and unreliable. There are often few such healthcare professionals so their time, health, and safety is especially important and they must be able to see and treat astounding numbers of patients each day to keep up with the demand. For these healthcare providers, the SlimShot Syringe allows them to have greater access to more pre-filled syringes. Such syringes make delivering treatment faster, easier, and more convenient, saving them time and frustration when compared to the vial method. In addition, as pre-filled syringes avoid the step of drawing up solution from a vial, there is reduced interaction with needles per medication administration, which reduces the chance of accidental needle sticks and occupational injuries for these providers. With the SlimShot Syringe, these providers can deliver better quality care that is faster, easier, more convenient, more precise, and safer for all involved.
Payer (healthcare org, government, or humanitarian org): These funding and procuring organizations are varied in type, but all experience limited budgets and are working to provide the most and best care for the least amount of money. The SlimShot Syringe allows them to stretch their budgets further while offering them access to pre-filled syringe technology and improved associated care and patient outcomes.
Planet: This group encompasses everyone living on our planet, but especially those living in low-resource settings who are disproportionately negatively impacted by climate change. For them, we offer a solution that allows healthcare delivery to improve and continue, but with a significantly reduced environmental footprint.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: Current syringe manufacturers and suppliers are not incentivized to optimize products for low-resource settings or fragile contexts as this work is challenging, time-consuming, and needs to be done with and in these communities. As the design for commercially available pre-filled syringes has remained stagnant for far too long, it is clear that a passionate and grounded team from outside of the commercial sector is needed to create and propel a feasible solution for these challenges.
Our background includes medical logistics, supply chain management, public health, humanitarian assistance, product management, human-centered design, and engineering. One of our founders and team lead has spent over 10 years physically delivering healthcare in fragile, emergency, and disaster settings around the world. He has also spent over six years working in medical logistics, supply chain system strengthening, and public health management in these settings. During his career, he has lived and worked closely with communities and professionals experiencing the challenges we have discussed in our application, including in Liberia, Tanzania, and the Bahamas. Throughout his education, including his Master of Public Health, he has concentrated on humanitarian studies, technology innovation, and the decolonization of global health. He is joined by two other founders who have extensive experience in human-centered design, user interviewing, business operations, and product co-designing.
Community and user input and co-design is at the center of our process and solution. We have co-designed, tested, and validated each iteration of our design with healthcare, supply chain, logistics, and humanitarian experts from around the world. The communities and experts engaged live and work in countries including Nigeria, Argentina, South Africa, Liberia, Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, Jamaica, Lebanon, the US, Germany, Canada, the UK, &amp; Australia. We consistently work with these users, communities, and stakeholders and they have been engaged with from the initial concept through 3D-printed model testing. We intend to continue to speak and work with other communities, users, and experts from around the world and have launched a survey to gather a larger and broader set of input and opinions on our idea and design. With sufficient funding, we will also complete test tooling and test product runs to then use in user focus groups and interviews. It is our priority to not be extractive of such communities and user experiences and knowledge, so having funding to appropriately compensate such stakeholders and communities for their time and contributions is crucial.

As the venture has grown into a full-fledged venture, we have focused on becoming a more diverse, equitable, representative, and inclusive team. 
As part of this, we have connected with and established various advisors from across the world that we work with, keep in touch with, and learn from and with. These advisors bring a wide variety of backgrounds and are from different countries, have different experiences, and educational backgrounds. This group is also made up of a variety of different races, ethnicities, cultures, religious groups, sexes, genders, and sexual identities.
At the same time, we have intentionally and regularly co-designed with, interviewed, and worked with stakeholders, users, and communities from across the world. They also come from a broad variety of backgrounds and have a wide range of social, cultural, and identity-based human attributes. It is our priority to not be extractive of such communities and user experiences and knowledge, so having funding to appropriately compensate such stakeholders and communities for their time and contributions is crucial.

Finally, we are also working with a DE&amp;I advisor and expert consultant at Harvard University who is supporting us in our mission and goal to become a more diverse, equitable, representative, and inclusive team. 
 What is your business model?: Our key customers and beneficiaries include: patients, healthcare providers, payers/procuring entities, and the planet.
We provide them with equitable access to high-quality, effective, safe, affordable, convenient, fast, easy-to-use pre-filled syringe solutions. These solutions hold the ability to provide morbidity and mortality-reducing medical treatment in less time, for less money, at a reduced environmental impact, and with improved patient and provider safety.
We will do this by establishing and protecting our unique SlimShot Syringe and then manufacturing and selling the components to existing pre-filled syringe makers and manufacturers. They will then integrate these components into their different pre-filled syringe solutions. Given the reduced packaging footprint of these solutions, payers, procurers, and consumers will then be able to access these at a reduced transport cost and receive more per box, thus reducing supply chain hurdles and bottlenecks in fragile and remote contexts. 
 Do you primarily provide products or services directly to individuals, to other organizations, or to the government?: Organizations (B2B)
 What is your plan for becoming financially sustainable, and what evidence can you provide that this plan has been successful so far?: For our initial startup and prototyping expenses we are using non-dilutive grant funding from venture programs, accelerators, and pitch competitions.
For our test tooling, test manufacturing runs, and pilot testing, we plan to continue to use such non-dilutive funding opportunities as well as apply for an SBIR grant.
For initial full manufacturing runs, we plan to open up to angel investors and venture capital for funding in exchange for a small percentage of our equity. We are also open to and exploring opportunities to do further pilots with NGOs and charitable groups, if funding allows.
After the initial full manufacturing runs, we plan to use the revenue to continue manufacturing runs with outsourced manufacturers. As we have not taken on debt, we will be able to continue to turn profits around into increased manufacturing runs without taking money out of the business.
As the global market for pre-filled syringes is massive and growing, we anticipate being able to capture enough of it to start with our initial manufacturing runs and get our foot into the door of this market.

<p>In Uganda, 98% of the population has no health insurance which exposes people to catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures. There is no national health scheme plan for Uganda at the moment. Uganda has a population of 44 million people, (70%) of whom live in rural areas. These problems affect the rural people more severely, especially the women and children. </p>
<p>According to the WHO report, 30% of the households in Africa borrow money to pay for healthcare. 15 million people are pushed into extreme poverty every single year due to out-of-pocket health expenditures and an estimated 1.6 million people die due to lack of access to affordable health services. </p>
<p>Community-based health insurance schemes/ health cooperatives have been adopted as a way to enable rural underserved communities to access health coverage. The majority of the people in rural communities belong to at least 1 affinity group eg. women, savings, investments, burial, work associations, teachers, farmers, etc. Leveraging this social solidarity, people pool money together to access healthcare from hospitals in their proximity. </p>
<p>Community-based health insurance schemes/heath cooperatives have been shown as a proven model to enable rural communities to access affordable health care in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Brazil. </p>

<p>There are 1,008 not-for-profit healthcare facilities in Uganda whose mission is to provide care at a low cost to vulnerable people. These not-for-profit hospitals usually find themselves in debt as they receive so many patients who are not able to pay for the subsidized healthcare they offer. When a non-for-profit healthcare facility runs a community scheme, it increases its source of funding and reduces its debt. </p>

<p>Members of a community health scheme save and pool resources together, hence get health coverage that enables them to access affordable healthcare. This prevents catastrophic health expenditures in case of a health emergency. Otherwise, families would sell their assets especially land which pushes them into the vicious cycle of poverty.

 Provide a one-line summary of your solution.: Closing the gap in health coverage in Uganda through digitalization of community health insurance schemes managed by hospitals.
 In what city, town, or region is your solution team headquartered?: Kampala, Uganda
 In what country is your solution team headquartered?: Uganda
 What type of organization is your solution team?: For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: nan
 What specific problem are you solving?: According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Universal Health Coverage Report (2019), 15 million Africans are pushed into extreme poverty each year due to catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures. 
In Uganda, 98% of the population has no health insurance which exposes people to catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures. There is no national health scheme plan for Uganda at the moment. Uganda has a population of 44 million people, (70%) of whom live in rural areas. These problems affect the rural people more severely, especially the women and children. 
According to the WHO report, 30% of the households in Africa borrow money to pay for healthcare. 15 million people are pushed into extreme poverty every single year due to out-of-pocket health expenditures and an estimated 1.6 million people die due to lack of access to affordable health services. 
Community-based health insurance schemes/ health cooperatives have been adopted as a way to enable rural underserved communities to access health coverage. The majority of the people in rural communities belong to at least 1 affinity group eg. women, savings, investments, burial, work associations, teachers, farmers, etc. Leveraging this social solidarity, people pool money together to access healthcare from hospitals in their proximity. 
Community-based health insurance schemes/heath cooperatives have been shown as a proven model to enable rural communities to access affordable health care in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Brazil. 
However, these schemes usually have inadequate capacity for management, strategic planning, and finance management. Fraud and lack of transparency and efficiency undermine their growth and scale. 

 What is your solution?: Stre@mline is a digital platform powered by artificial intelligence that facilitates community health insurance by enabling rural groups to pool resources together while providing hospitals with the technology and tools to provide affordable health coverage to the groups in their communities. 
Stre@mline Ubuntu digital platform has 4 components:
An Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system that cover all aspects of the patient journey while delivering key patient safety prompts to clinicians. The EMR provides data that powers our business intelligence platform.Scheme administration platform used by hospitals to manage all scheme operations including member registration, identification using barcodes and fingerprint scanners to avoid fraud, claims management, reporting, etc.An Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) enabled mobile application that enables community groups/individuals to enroll, save money, and pay premiums with mobile money in flexible installments.A business intelligence analytics platform powered by artificial intelligence that is key for keeping costs manageable and for health promotion. Artificial intelligence supports pattern analysis, uncovering useful epidemiology trends to target health promotion and minimizing costs, forecasting usage of resources eg. medicines, and staff; key for planning and identifying potential cost savings opportunities and fraud detection.
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : Our solutions target rural not-for-profit healthcare facilities and the communities they serve.
There are 1,008 not-for-profit healthcare facilities in Uganda whose mission is to provide care at a low cost to vulnerable people. These not-for-profit hospitals usually find themselves in debt as they receive so many patients who are not able to pay for the subsidized healthcare they offer. When a non-for-profit healthcare facility runs a community scheme, it increases its source of funding and reduces its debt. 
There has been published studies that show how hospitals are more sustainable because of community health schemes. “Kisiizi Hospital health insurance scheme improved access to health services, provided a stable source of funding and reduced bad debts to the hospital. Internal and external factors to e-Society enforced enrolment and retention of members in Kisiizi hospital health insurance scheme.""- Development of the Kisiizi hospital health insurance scheme: lessons learned and implications for universal health coverage:  Sebastian Olikira Baine; Alex Kakama and Moses Mugume
Our solution targets rural underserved communities that are usually left out of insurance programs because they do not have formal employment or salaries to access traditional insurance. The daily average wage for families in the rural locations of Uganda is $2. 
An independent report done by the Economist magazine showed that the insured are healthier and their finances, too. Reference: The Economist magazine.
Members of a community health scheme save and pool resources together, hence get health coverage that enables them to access affordable healthcare. This prevents catastrophic health expenditures in case of a health emergency. Otherwise, families would sell their assets especially land which pushes them into the vicious cycle of poverty.

Independent studies have been done by researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany. These were the results:
a)    In children under 5 years of age, 1 year of a household’s participation in community-based health insurance was associated with a 4.3 percentage point less probability of childhood stunting.

b)    Enrolment in the scheme increased the probability of using a mosquito net by 26% and deworming by 18%

c)     A hospital’s involvement in the scheme increased the source of funding and reduced the debt burden.

Consequently, patients are not reaping the full benefits of their treatment.
To address this issue, TrueMed was established with an unwavering dedication to enhancing healthcare in our nation. It is a sophisticated mobile app that aims to offer expert guidance on medication management by pharmacist and other health experts, empowering users with a deeper comprehension of their disease and optimizing treatment results.

88742,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,"HartBeep is an arrhythmia sensor with an alert system greater than 10 meters, database, and environmentally friendly energy source.","Provincia de Puntarenas, Puntarenas, Costa Rica",Costa Rica,Not registered as any organization,,"<p>The project I am developing aims to address a critical gap in healthcare, specifically in the field of detection and monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias. The lack of access to specialized health services, especially in rural communities and marginalized urban areas, has generated a global public health problem with important consequences.</p>
<p>Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases represent an overwhelming burden on health systems, being the main cause of mortality. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 17.9 million people die each year due to cardiovascular diseases, accounting for 31% of all deaths globally. Within this spectrum, it is estimated that more than 33 million people suffer from atrial fibrillation, one of the most common forms of cardiac arrhythmias, increasing their risk of strokes and serious cardiovascular events.</p>
<p>In rural communities, the situation is worsened due to geographical distance, lack of medical infrastructure, and shortage of trained health professionals. According to WHO data, approximately 70% of deaths from cardiovascular diseases occur in rural areas, where access to specialized medical care is limited. This results in late diagnoses, inadequate treatments, and significant burden on patients and their families.</p>
<p>Similarly, in densely populated urban settings, overcrowding of health systems can lead to delays in care and inaccurate diagnoses, further exacerbating the problem. According to statistics from the American Heart Association, more than 6 million people in the United States live with atrial fibrillation and it is estimated that this number will continue to increase due to the aging of the population and other risk factors.</p>
<p>The solution I propose is an innovative cardiac arrhythmia sensor, designed with ecological materials and a sustainable energy source to minimize its environmental footprint. This sensor offers an intuitive interface, making it accessible even to those with little technological experience. By not requiring Internet connectivity or additional devices, such as cell phones, an important barrier to its implementation in areas with limited resources is overcome.</p>
<p>Additionally, the sensor's ability to store data allows for continuous monitoring of patients' cardiovascular health, making it easier for local doctors to make informed decisions and early intervention when necessary. This tool not only improves the quality of patient care, but also contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of local health systems.</p>
<p>In summary, this project represents a significant advance in healthcare, addressing a critical public health issue through technological innovation and commitment to environmental sustainability. By offering a comprehensive and accessible solution, I hope to positively impact the lives of millions of people.</p>

 What specific problem are you solving?: The project I am developing aims to address a critical gap in healthcare, specifically in the field of detection and monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias. The lack of access to specialized health services, especially in rural communities and marginalized urban areas, has generated a global public health problem with important consequences.
Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases represent an overwhelming burden on health systems, being the main cause of mortality. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 17.9 million people die each year due to cardiovascular diseases, accounting for 31% of all deaths globally. Within this spectrum, it is estimated that more than 33 million people suffer from atrial fibrillation, one of the most common forms of cardiac arrhythmias, increasing their risk of strokes and serious cardiovascular events.
In rural communities, the situation is worsened due to geographical distance, lack of medical infrastructure, and shortage of trained health professionals. According to WHO data, approximately 70% of deaths from cardiovascular diseases occur in rural areas, where access to specialized medical care is limited. This results in late diagnoses, inadequate treatments, and significant burden on patients and their families.
Similarly, in densely populated urban settings, overcrowding of health systems can lead to delays in care and inaccurate diagnoses, further exacerbating the problem. According to statistics from the American Heart Association, more than 6 million people in the United States live with atrial fibrillation and it is estimated that this number will continue to increase due to the aging of the population and other risk factors.
The solution I propose is an innovative cardiac arrhythmia sensor, designed with ecological materials and a sustainable energy source to minimize its environmental footprint. This sensor offers an intuitive interface, making it accessible even to those with little technological experience. By not requiring Internet connectivity or additional devices, such as cell phones, an important barrier to its implementation in areas with limited resources is overcome.
Additionally, the sensor's ability to store data allows for continuous monitoring of patients' cardiovascular health, making it easier for local doctors to make informed decisions and early intervention when necessary. This tool not only improves the quality of patient care, but also contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of local health systems.
In summary, this project represents a significant advance in healthcare, addressing a critical public health issue through technological innovation and commitment to environmental sustainability. By offering a comprehensive and accessible solution, I hope to positively impact the lives of millions of people.
I hope you can give this project a chance. Heart Beep was designed to save lives while giving thousands of people the opportunity to have the right to health.
 What is your solution?: HeartBeep es un dispositivo innovador diseñado para la detección y monitorización precisa de arritmias cardíacas. Este sensor utiliza tecnología avanzada para analizar continuamente el ritmo cardíaco del paciente, permitiendo la identificación temprana de posibles irregularidades que puedan indicar un episodio de arritmia.
El dispositivo funciona mediante un proceso minucioso: el sensor principal registra los impulsos cardíacos del individuo, almacenando esta información en una base de datos para su posterior análisis y seguimiento. Cuando se detecta una anomalía importante en el ritmo cardíaco, el sensor envía una señal de alerta a un segundo dispositivo, que notifica la situación al médico o al cuidador del paciente.
El segundo dispositivo está equipado con imágenes de electrocardiograma (ECG), lo que proporciona al médico profesional una herramienta valiosa para una evaluación detallada y precisa de la frecuencia cardíaca. Este completo sistema de alerta y monitorización está basado en la tecnología Arduino. En cuanto a diseño y construcción, HeartBeep incorpora componentes impresos en 3D y plástico reutilizable, lo que no sólo aporta durabilidad y resistencia al dispositivo, sino que también contribuye a su viabilidad económica y sostenibilidad medioambiental. Además, el chaleco utilizado para transportar el sensor está confeccionado con tejidos cómodos y amigables para el paciente, asegurando su comodidad durante todo el proceso de monitoreo.
Destacando su compromiso con la responsabilidad medioambiental, HeartBeep integra una fuente de energía respetuosa con el medio ambiente. Esta combinación de tecnología de punta, materiales de alta calidad y diseño ergonómico lo posiciona como una solución efectiva y sofisticada para la detección temprana y el manejo efectivo de arritmias cardíacas, tanto en entornos rurales como urbanos.

 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : La población objetivo de HeartBeep son aquellas personas que padecen arritmias cardíacas, tanto en entornos rurales como urbanos, y que actualmente carecen de acceso adecuado a servicios especializados de detección y seguimiento.
Actualmente, esta población está desatendida debido a una serie de factores, incluida la escasez de recursos médicos y profesionales en las zonas rurales, así como la saturación de los sistemas de salud en los entornos urbanos. Como resultado, muchos pacientes no reciben atención médica oportuna y adecuada para sus enfermedades cardíacas, lo que puede provocar retrasos en el diagnóstico, tratamientos inadecuados y un mayor riesgo de complicaciones graves.
La solución propuesta por HeartBeep aborda estas necesidades de forma integral. En primer lugar, ofrece un dispositivo de detección y monitorización de arritmias cardíacas que proporciona alertas tempranas sobre posibles irregularidades del ritmo cardíaco.

88773,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,UV-LED based water disinfection system for remote  areas,"Tel Aviv, Israel",Israel,Nonprofit,,"<p>The United Nations' sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) emphasizes the need for the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This is particularly crucial in economically underdeveloped rural regions, where communities often rely on untreated water from natural sources like rivers, lakes, or unprotected wells. Drinking water from surface water and unimproved sources such as unprotected dug wells or unprotected springs presents the greatest risk to public health. At current rates of progress, more than one-third of countries will not achieve universal access to an ‘improved’ source of drinking water by 2030. 
  </p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2022, an estimated 1.7 billion people globally used a drinking water source contaminated with feces. Moreover, ~ 1 in 5 children do not have access to sufficient water to meet their needs (UNICEF, 2021). Globally, in 2020, out of the wastewater flows generated by households (HH) connected to sewers or septic tanks; almost half were not treated safely. The lack of adequate technologies and services for water quality improvement, coupled with infrastructure challenges such as intermittent electricity, inadequate piping systems, lack of skilled maintenance personnel, and broken supply chain intensifies public health risks. As a result, 88% of diarrhea-associated deaths are attributable to unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient hygiene, and diarrheal diseases are the second leading cause of death among children under 5 years. While efforts to address this challenge are intensifying, the lack of available and sustainable solutions to safe drinking water persists as a barrier to empowering households and communities. Moreover, a lack of available and safe water can be a source of regional conflicts. 
  </p>
<p>Many communities collect water from unimproved sources and store water in their household, often in open containers without any treatment of the water or residual disinfectant. The challenges in community and household disinfection systems encompass a variety of factors, including raising awareness about the significance of water safety, understanding the hazards of contaminated water, and the expenses associated with providing clean water. For household systems, there are additional challenges as the necessary steps to purify the water, which include obtaining it from a safe source, treating it through prefiltration and disinfection units, and maintaining and cleaning the water storage containers. Moreover, factors like the willingness to pay for safe water are influenced by various elements, such as cost, awareness of its importance, cultural issues, effort required, and location, especially for those living below the poverty line. In addition according to the JMP report, less than two-thirds of healthcare facilities have an improved water source within 500 m. Consequently, the scale of the problem related to safe water is considerable in the communities we are working in with people who use a drinking water source contaminated with feces. In Uganda, out of its population of 47 million people, 38 million people (81% of the population) lack access to safe water, and in India, out of its population of 1.4 billion people, 35 million people lack access to safe water (https://water.org).

<p>Detailed examples: In a village in South India, a field test was conducted for a household UV LED water treatment solution tailored to rural settings and currently also in urban settings in collaboration with ICCW. The focus was on integrating UV devices on the taps of household water containers. Given the region's intermittent electricity, this project aimed to provide a point-of-use treatment solution that would fit the local context and consumption patterns. In the case study in India, understanding the local community's practice of storing water in various types of unmaintained containers revealed significant re-contamination risks even in cases where the community stored clean and fresh water from the community's local reverse osmosis treatment facility. This insight was crucial in developing a UV LED system that could be integrated with household water containers, ensuring water remains safe even after storage.
  </p>
<p>In another village in Uganda, the implementation of a community UV-LED water disinfection system involved integrating 40 L per minute UV-LED reactors with existing solar-powered water infrastructure, addressing the absence of a reliable power supply; collaboration with Innovation Africa. This system provides the community with consistent access to disinfected water, improving health outcomes and reducing dependence on unreliable water sources. The community's reliance on community taps highlighted a culture adapted to intermittent water availability. Integrating UV technology into existing water practices was essential to ensure acceptance. By aligning technology with existing behaviors, such as using community taps and solar power, the solution was more readily adopted and sustained.

</p>","<p>Our business model at SoLED is structured to provide maximum value to the populations we serve, focusing both on the impactful delivery of safe drinking water and the sustainability of the service through various revenue streams. The approach we take is tailored to the specific needs and capabilities of each community we work with, using a dual strategy that balances communal benefit with economic sustainability. 
  </p>
<p>Communal Approach: In this model, we provide our water treatment systems to communities at a low or no cost, often partnering with community-based organizations (CBOs) and local governing bodies. The systems are designed to require minimal fees or effort from the community members themselves, making safe water accessible without direct charges. This model is particularly effective in achieving high usage rates and ensuring that the benefits of clean water reach as many people as possible. However, this approach typically relies on external funding, such as subsidies from the government or donations from international aid organizations, to cover the installation and ongoing maintenance costs. While this can limit the number of installations due to budget constraints, it ensures water safety is not compromised by the community’s ability to pay.
  </p>
<p>Cost Recovery Approach: Conversely, our cost recovery model involves handing over the systems to dedicated organizations that can manage the operations sustainably by charging a small fee to the users. This can include local entrepreneurs or restricted consumer committees who are authorized to collect fees for water usage. The revenue generated is then used to maintain the system and fund further expansions, thus increasing the number of installations possible and enhancing the sustainability of the impact. This model empowers communities by fostering local entrepreneurship and ensures the longevity of the system through regular maintenance funded by the collected fees. It also encourages community members to value the service more, as they have a direct stake in its continuity. 
  </p>
<p>Customization According to Local Settings: Recognizing the diverse needs and capabilities of different communities, we customize our business model according to the specific settings where we deploy our technology. This involves conducting extensive field research to understand the socio-economic dynamics at play and to design a system that aligns with local preferences and capacities. 
</p>",Organizations (B2B),"<p>SoLED has been primarily supported by the Asper Foundation Clean Water Fund for Bringing Clean Water to the Developing World from 2020 to 2023, alongside additional donors and grants. Our strategy for funding the development of our core technology relies on grants and donations, with a vision to transition towards generating revenue through sales via distributing organizations post-field demonstration.
  </p>
<p>NGO Funding Model: partnerships with NGOs that can fund the purchase and installation of water systems. NGOs often cover the costs of setting up and maintaining the systems, ensuring that communities do not bear the financial burden. The community pays minimal coast for maintenance. 
  </p>
<p>Support from Donors and Grants: We actively seek funding from donors and grants, which are crucial for supporting both the deployment of new systems and the research and development of more efficient technologies. This external funding is essential for expanding our reach and enhancing the effectiveness of our solutions. 
  </p>
<p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Initiatives: Corporate partnerships through CSR initiatives provide another layer of financial support. Companies looking to invest in sustainable and socially responsible projects can fund the installation and maintenance of water systems, aligning their brand with impactful community development.
  </p>
<p>We plan to fund the development of the core technology with grants and donations, and further upon field demonstration sell our device through distributing organizations.  We plan with your support, if granted, to hire a business consultant to prepare a business plan that will include components for bringing in money to fund our work, whether through sustained donations and grants, selling products or services, or raising investment capital.

 What specific problem are you solving?: Problem 1: Healthcare Access Barriers and Delays
Access to healthcare is universally recognized as a critical issue, yet it disproportionately affects those in underserved communities, exacerbating health disparities. The existing system, where patients must choose between emergency care and scheduled appointments, inherently delays diagnosis and treatment. These delays are particularly detrimental to individuals in underserved areas, where even reaching an emergency room or clinic poses a significant challenge. Additionally, for people who are underprivileged, the barriers are not just physical but also financial and informational, making timely access to healthcare even more difficult. The resulting uncertainty and waiting times fuel anxiety and stress, especially in these communities, amplifying the fear of the unknown and negatively impacting mental health.
  
Appointments often come with waiting times that can extend to a week or more, delaying the diagnosis and exacerbating the patient's condition. For those seeking emergency care, the process is marred by lengthy hours spent in waiting rooms, undergoing the triage process before even a preliminary assessment is made. This waiting period, filled with uncertainty, breeds anxiety and stress, contributing to the overall deterioration of the patient's well-being.
  
Problem 2: The Clinical Documentation Burden: Compromising Care and Provider Well-being
  
Once a patient is finally seen by a healthcare provider, the interaction is often hindered by the cumbersome process of clinical documentation. As the clinician attempts to listen to the patient's symptoms while simultaneously taking detailed notes, the quality of care is compromised. This split focus not only diminishes the effectiveness of patient communication but also imposes a significant administrative burden on providers. The result is a healthcare experience that feels less personal and more procedural, further distancing patients from the care they need and contributing to provider burnout. This administrative overload not only detracts from the quality of patient care but also imposes a significant strain on healthcare providers, leading to increased stress levels and diminished job satisfaction.
  
The overwhelming burden of clinical documentation significantly impacts healthcare delivery. Clinicians find themselves caught in a relentless cycle of paperwork, which not only detracts from patient care but also leads to increased stress and reduced productivity. This administrative load means less time is available for direct patient interaction, leading to a diminished quality of care. Furthermore, the time spent on documentation encroaches upon personal time, affecting work-life balance and contributing to burnout among healthcare providers.

 Provide a one-line summary of your solution.: Young Mums Unite facilitates support groups providing young mothers with crucial SRHR information, emotional support, and access to essential services
 In what city, town, or region is your solution team headquartered?: Shinyanga, Tanzania
 In what country is your solution team headquartered?: Tanzania
 What type of organization is your solution team?: Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: nan
 What specific problem are you solving?: The specific problem that Young Mums Unite is solving is the lack of access to accurate and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) information, services, and emotional support for young mothers aged 15-24 in Tanzania and globally.
In Tanzania, the scale of this problem is considerable. According to the United Nations Population Fund, 27% of girls aged 15-19 have begun childbearing, one of the highest rates in the world. This means that an estimated 270,000 girls in Tanzania become mothers before the age of 20 each year.
Globally, the issue is even more widespread. It is estimated that 16 million girls aged 15 to 19 and 1 million girls under the age of 15 give birth every year, the vast majority of whom live in low- and middle-income countries. These young mothers often face significant challenges in accessing accurate SRHR information, essential health services, and emotional support.
The factors contributing to this problem that relate to the Young Mums Unite solution include:
Lack of access to accurate and comprehensive SRHR information: Many young mothers lack the knowledge and understanding of their sexual and reproductive health, which limits their ability to make informed choices.Inadequate healthcare infrastructure: Young mothers often face barriers in accessing essential health services, such as family planning, antenatal care, and postnatal care.Societal stigma and discrimination: Young mothers are often stigmatized and discriminated against by their communities and healthcare providers, deterring them from seeking the support they need.
By addressing these core issues, the Young Mums Unite solution aims to empower young mothers and improve their sexual and reproductive health outcomes, ultimately contributing to better health and well-being for them and their children.
 What is your solution?: Young Mums Unite is a community-based solution that provides support groups for young mothers aged 15-24, offering them access to essential sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) information, emotional support, and services.
At the core of our solution are the support groups, which are facilitated by trained professionals and bring together young mothers from similar backgrounds. In these groups, participants engage in discussions and activities focused on SRHR, parenting, and personal development. The groups create a safe and non-judgmental space for young mothers to share their experiences, learn from one another, and receive guidance from the facilitators.
To complement the support groups, we have partnered with local healthcare providers to ensure that young mothers can access the SRHR services they need, such as family planning, antenatal care, postnatal care, and counseling. Our facilitators help young mothers navigate the healthcare system and connect them with the appropriate services.
In addition, we provide young mothers with educational materials and resources, including pamphlets, booklets, and online information, to further their understanding of SRHR topics. This helps to address the lack of access to accurate and comprehensive information that many young mothers face.
To enhance our reach and impact, we have also integrated a technological component into our solution. We are developing an AI-powered chatbot that will provide young mothers with 24/7 access to SRHR information in a private and confidential manner. The chatbot will offer immediate answers to their questions, empowering them to make informed decisions about their health.
By combining the support groups, access to services, educational resources, and the AI-powered chatbot, Young Mums Unite aims to holistically address the needs of young mothers and improve their sexual and reproductive health outcomes.
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : Our solution, Young Mums Unite, serves young mothers aged 15-24 in Tanzania, and has the potential to expand to serve young mothers globally. This population is often marginalized and lacks access to the necessary support and services required during and after pregnancy.
In Tanzania, the scale of the problem is considerable. According to the United Nations Population Fund, 27% of girls aged 15-19, or approximately 270,000 girls, have begun childbearing each year. These young mothers face significant challenges, including:
Lack of Information: Many of the 270,000 young mothers in Tanzania lack accurate and comprehensive information about sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), making it difficult for them to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.Emotional Support: Pregnancy and motherhood can be particularly challenging for young mothers, who often feel isolated and overwhelmed, with limited access to emotional support.Access to Services: Young mothers frequently face barriers in accessing essential health services, such as family planning, antenatal care, postnatal care, and counseling.Stigmatization and Discrimination: In many communities, young mothers face stigmatization and discrimination, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being.
Young Mums Unite addresses these needs through our support groups, which provide a safe and non-judgmental space for young mothers to connect with peers, share their experiences, and receive emotional support. The groups are facilitated by trained professionals who offer accurate and evidence-based information on SRHR, parenting, and personal development.
Our partnerships with local healthcare providers ensure that young mothers have access to essential health services, and our facilitators help them navigate the healthcare system and access the services they need.
By providing the 270,000 young mothers in Tanzania with the knowledge, support, and services they require, Young Mums Unite empowers them to make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health and well-being. This, in turn, contributes to improved health outcomes for young mothers and their children, and fosters a sense of community and support that is crucial for their personal development and empowerment.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: The leadership and team of Young Mums Unite are exceptionally well-positioned to deliver this solution due to their direct proximity and personal connection to the communities they serve.
Our team is led by Juliana Magesa, a young woman who has personally experienced the challenges faced by young mothers in Tanzania. Juliana became a mother at the age of 17, and her firsthand experience of navigating the lack of SRHR information, emotional support, and access to services fuels her deep passion and commitment to supporting other young mothers.
Joining Juliana on the team are three other Tanzanian women, each bringing unique perspectives and expertise to the solution:
1. Fatima Mushi, a registered nurse with 5 years of experience in community-based healthcare. Fatima's knowledge of the local healthcare system and her connections with service providers are invaluable in ensuring young mothers can access the services they need.
2. Amina Omari, a social worker with a background in counseling and youth development. Amina's expertise in providing emotional support and facilitating group discussions is crucial to the success of the support groups.
3. Neema Kibona, a community organizer with a strong track record of engaging marginalized populations. Neema's skills in outreach, community mobilization, and participatory design are integral to the solution's implementation and sustainability.
The diversity of our team, both in terms of personal experiences and professional expertise, ensures a holistic approach to addressing the needs of young mothers in Tanzania. Importantly, the team's close connection to the target communities is reflected in the design and implementation of our solution.
We engage in regular community consultations to understand the specific challenges and aspirations of young mothers, and we co-design our support groups and educational materials with their input. This ensures that the solution is culturally appropriate, responsive to the communities' needs, and empowers young mothers as active participants in the process.
By leveraging the team's unique positionality and the meaningful engagement of the communities we serve, Young Mums Unite is exceptionally well-positioned to deliver a transformative solution that improves the sexual and reproductive health and well-being of young mothers in Tanzania.
 Which dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address?: Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).
 Which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals does your solution address?: 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 4. Quality Education, 5. Gender Equality
 What is your solution’s stage of development?: Growth
 Please share details about why you selected the stage above.: Young Mums Unite is currently in the Pilot stage of our solution. To date, we have served 430 young mothers aged 15-24 in the Shinyanga and Tabora regions of Tanzania.
Our pilot program includes the core components of our solution: support groups, partnerships with local healthcare providers, and the integration of an AI-powered chatbot. The support groups provide a safe and non-judgmental space for young mothers to connect with their peers, share experiences, and receive emotional support and SRHR information from trained facilitators. 
Through our healthcare partnerships, we ensure that young mothers can access essential services such as family planning, antenatal care, postnatal care, and counseling. Our facilitators help navigate the healthcare system and connect young mothers to the services they need.
Complementing the in-person support, our AI-powered chatbot offers young mothers 24/7 access to SRHR information in a private and confidential manner. The chatbot provides immediate answers to their questions, empowering them to make informed decisions about their health.
The pilot phase has allowed us to test the effectiveness of this holistic approach and gather valuable feedback from the young mothers we serve. We have observed positive outcomes, including increased knowledge of SRHR, improved access to healthcare services, and enhanced emotional well-being among participants.
However, as we are still in the pilot stage, our solution is not yet an established, consistent model available in multiple communities. We are focused on refining our approach, strengthening partnerships, and gathering more data to demonstrate the impact of our solution. Once we have solidified the model, we will be well-positioned to scale our efforts and reach more young mothers in need of support across Tanzania and potentially beyond.
 Why are you applying to Solve?: We are applying to Solve because the program's unique approach to supporting innovative solutions aligns closely with the needs and aspirations of Young Mums Unite. Specifically, we hope that Solve can help us overcome the following barriers:
Financial Barriers: As a non-profit organization, we face the constant challenge of securing sustainable funding to support our operations and expansion. The Solve program's access to a global network of funders and partners could help us secure the necessary financial resources to scale our solution and reach more young mothers in Tanzania and beyond.

As the founder of Young Mums Unite, I had been actively following the work of Solve and was excited to see the launch of the new Global Challenges, which aligned perfectly with the mission and focus of our solution. The opportunity to connect with Solve's global network of innovators, experts, and partners is particularly valuable for us as we seek to scale our impact.
 What makes your solution innovative?: Young Mums Unite's solution is innovative in its holistic and technology-enabled approach to addressing the complex challenges faced by young mothers in Tanzania.
At the core of our innovation is the integration of support groups, healthcare service provision, and AI-powered technology to create a comprehensive and accessible support system for young mothers. This sets us apart from traditional siloed approaches that often fall short in fully meeting the diverse needs of this population.
The support groups are a particularly innovative element, as they provide a safe and judgment-free space for young mothers to connect with their peers, share experiences, and receive emotional support and SRHR information. By fostering a sense of community and belonging, these groups empower young mothers and help to destigmatize the challenges they face.
The seamless integration of healthcare service provision through local partnerships further enhances the impact of our solution. By ensuring that young mothers can access essential services, we address a critical gap in the existing healthcare landscape and empower them to take charge of their sexual and reproductive health.
The integration of an AI-powered chatbot sets our solution apart technologically. This innovative feature gives young mothers 24/7 access to SRHR information in a private and confidential manner, addressing the significant knowledge gap that many young mothers face. The chatbot's ability to provide immediate, personalized responses can catalyze broader positive impacts by inspiring similar technological interventions in the SRHR space.
The holistic and technology-driven nature of our solution has the potential to transform the landscape of support for young mothers in Tanzania. By addressing the interconnected barriers they face, we can not only improve individual health outcomes but also contribute to broader societal changes, such as reducing stigma, empowering young women, and promoting gender equality.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: Young Mums Unite's theory of change is based on the premise that by providing a comprehensive, community-led support system, we can improve the sexual and reproductive health and well-being of young mothers in Tanzania. Our core activities include:1. Establishing support groups facilitated by trained professionals to provide young mothers with emotional support, SRHR education, and personal development opportunities.2. Partnering with local healthcare providers to ensure young mothers have access to essential services, such as family planning, antenatal care, and postnatal care.3. Integrating an AI-powered chatbot that gives young mothers 24/7 access to accurate, personalized SRHR information and guidance.
The immediate outputs of these activities are:Increased knowledge and awareness of SRHR among young mothersImproved access to essential healthcare servicesEnhanced emotional well-being and sense of community among young mothers
These outputs are expected to lead to the following outcomes:Improved sexual and reproductive health outcomes for young mothers and their childrenReduced stigma and discrimination towards young mothers within their communitiesIncreased empowerment and agency of young mothers to make informed decisions about their health and futures
The theory of change is supported by evidence from various studies. Research has shown that community-based support groups can effectively improve mental health and social well-being among young mothers, while access to comprehensive SRHR information and services can lead to better health outcomes.
The integration of technology-enabled solutions, such as AI-powered chatbots, has been found to increase the reach and accessibility of SRHR education, particularly among marginalized populations.
By addressing the interconnected barriers faced by young mothers in Tanzania, Young Mums Unite's holistic approach has the potential to create a significant and sustainable impact on the lives of our target population, while also contributing to broader societal changes.
 What are your impact goals for your solution and how are you measuring your progress towards them?: Young Mums Unite's primary impact goal is to improve the sexual and reproductive health and well-being of young mothers in Tanzania. Specifically, we aim to:
Increase knowledge and awareness of SRHR among 10,000 young mothers by 2026.Improve access to essential healthcare services for 7,500 young mothers by 2026.Enhance the emotional well-being and sense of community among 8,000 young mothers by 2026.
To measure our progress towards these goals, we have established the following key performance indicators (KPIs):
Knowledge and Awareness:Percentage of young mothers who demonstrate increased knowledge of SRHR topics, as measured through pre- and post-intervention assessments.Number of young mothers who access the AI-powered chatbot and engage with SRHR content.
Access to Healthcare Services:Number of young mothers who are successfully referred and connected to essential healthcare services, such as family planning, antenatal care, and postnatal care.Percentage of young mothers who report improved satisfaction with the quality of healthcare services received.
Emotional Well-being and CommunityPercentage of young mothers who report improved mental health and emotional well-being, as measured through standardized assessment tools.Number of young mothers who actively participate in the support groups and report a stronger sense of community and belonging.
These KPIs are aligned with the relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality). We collect data through a combination of surveys, monitoring of program activities, and impact evaluations conducted in partnership with local research institutions.
By regularly tracking and reporting on these indicators, we can continuously assess the effectiveness of our solution, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to maximize the impact on young mothers in Tanzania.
 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: The core technology powering the Young Mums Unite solution is an AI-powered chatbot that provides young mothers in Tanzania with 24/7 access to accurate, personalized SRHR information and guidance.
The chatbot is built on a conversational AI platform that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to understand the user's questions and queries, and to generate relevant and tailored responses. The platform is integrated with a comprehensive SRHR knowledge base, developed in collaboration with local healthcare providers and SRHR experts, to ensure the information provided is contextually appropriate and evidence-based.
A key innovation of our chatbot is its ability to engage in two-way dialogues, allowing young mothers to not only receive information but also ask follow-up questions, share their concerns, and receive personalized advice. This interactive approach helps to build trust and empower young mothers to take a more active role in managing their sexual and reproductive health.
The chatbot is designed to be accessible and user-friendly, with a simple, intuitive interface and the option to switch between multiple local languages. This ensures that young mothers, regardless of their digital literacy or access to smartphones, can easily navigate the platform and benefit from its services.
In addition to the chatbot, our solution also leverages other technologies, such as mobile-based platforms for coordinating support group activities and secure data management systems for monitoring and evaluating our program's impact. By integrating these various technological components, Young Mums Unite is able to create a holistic, tech-enabled ecosystem of support for young mothers in Tanzania.

 What is your solution?: El Sistema de innovación territorial (SIT), propone un escalamiento de acciones territoriales desde un sentido participativo y transformador. La acción en sí, actúa permanentemente en la interfaz relacional entre técnicos y campesinos que logran construir un proyecto colectivo, que interviene en cuatro variables (comercialización, formación de los actores, readaptación de políticas públicas y consolidación de mesas de gestión territorial).
 Las acciones territoriales del SIT, permiten la readaptación de políticas públicas estandarizadas que a partir de la articulación de instituciones en diferentes niveles multiescalares, contribuyendo al abordaje de la salud con comunidades campesinas. El SIT, le da un enfoque sistémico a la red de agentes que a través de sus interacciones van institucionalizando la acción colectiva permitiendo un marco político innovador, determinado por las características del territorios, generando herramientas de intervención concretas, a la vez que se le puede Dar un sentido teórico y abstracto que genera un marco conceptual el cual explica dichas interacciones. En la aplicación del SIT, a un territorio, este interviene en el desarrollo de políticas públicas, concretando un dispositivo de abordaje territorial (DAT), que se traduce en un plan de erradicación de zoonosis que se caracteriza por su abordaje integral bajo el enfoque de una salud situada.
En concreto dicho dispositivo vinculo instituciones de investigación de Argentina (laboratorio de Imunoparasitología (Laimpa) el Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (Conicet), el Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria (INTA), con las Universidades Nacionales del mismo país, (la Universidad nacional de Salta y la Universidad nacional de La Plata), con las organizaciones territoriales, Organización Campesina de segundo grado ( Comunidades Unidas de Molinos) ONG Red valles de Altura, el Servicio de Sanidad Animal( SENASA), el ente sanitario Alto Valle Calchaquí, la municipalidad de Seclantas del departamento de Molinos, Salta, entre otras.
En el abordaje integral para la gestión de riesgos sanitarios, se generó instancias de formación en el marco de la construcción colectiva del conocimiento, rescatando los saberes ancestrales del territorio en la formación de promotores del buen vivir, técnicos y estudiantes, que a partir de la realización de diagnósticos serológicos se identifican parasitosis que afectan la salud humana, animal y vegetal. Una vez comprobada la presencia de dichos parásitos, se generó una mesa interinstitucional donde se construyó un plan de erradicación adaptado al territorio, teniendo en cuenta su geografía, el medio ambiente, las capacidades instaladas, la cosmovisión de los productores, etc.
La prevención y el control de las enfermedades parasitarias permitieron disminuir además el uso indiscriminado de antimicrobianos y antiparasitarios en animales, así como de plaguicidas en verduras, lo que disminuyó la contaminación del agua, a la vez que se fortalece la ganadería y la agricultura agroecológica.

 Please share details about why you selected the stage above.: Desde el año 2003 hasta la actualidad el Sistema de innovación territorial se fue consolidando, permitiendo que las comunidades campesinas que se encontraban en una situación de opresión y pobreza se convirtieran en una organización de segundo grado lo suficientemente empoderada como para gestionar los riesgos sanitarios desde toda su integralidad, transformando políticas estandarizadas en dispositivos participativos que se traducen en el territorio en planes de control y erradicación de enfermedades zoonóticas, instalación de un matadero de tránsito provincial para la faena de animales menores administrado por la organización, que además de disminuir los riesgos de salud publica permite la comercialización y acceso a carne de calidad, a la vez que administran su propia carnicería. Lo que permitió el mejoramiento habitacional, el acceso al agua potable, la instalación de sanitarios erradicando las letrinas, la recuperación de suelos cultivables a partir del manejo del ganado y la producción agroecológica de los cultivos. La disminución de enfermedades parasitarias en la población, no solo por los planes de control y erradicación, sino por disminuir la contaminación ambiental del agua. Podemos decir que Seclantas esta en camino de convertirse en un territorio saludable. Que se encuentra disponible un marco analístico para comprender el proceso de desarrollo que viene atravesando, lo que permite además ser un laboratorio territorial donde investigadores y estudiantes desarrollan sus doctorados y tesis de grado en una vinculación exitosa con universidades y centros de investigación.
 Why are you applying to Solve?: El Sistema de innovación territorial puede ser replicado en cualquier territorio donde la población decida ser parte de la solución a sus problemas. Nuestro interés en que este sistema sea visibilizado y replicado en otras regiones del país y del mundo, que los investigadores y técnicos de terreno puedan contribuir además a la generación de políticas públicas que revisen los estándares de salud a nivel mundial, que muchas veces desconocen la realidad de la población y se convierte en legislaciones restrictivas en vez de promotoras de desarrollo.
Buscamos que los instrumentos de abordaje territorial para la gestión de la salud animal en una relación global, local y centro periferia sean adaptados a los estándares de salud pública y animal de granja o territorios y sistemas de producción específicos, puedan ser democráticos y permitamos sobre todo. . . . . . disminuir los riegos sanitarios abordando la salud en toda su integralidad.

 What is your plan for becoming financially sustainable, and what evidence can you provide that this plan has been successful so far?: El sistema es sostenible ya que se ancla sobre todo en los saberes locales, y visibiliza las potencialidades de un territorio que comienza a ser foco de las políticas publicas existentes que se encuentran muchas veces atomizadas y bajan a los territorios de manera desordenados no logrando el impacto esperado.
La experiencia propuesta se sostiene desde hace mas de 6 años, a partir de la integralidad de las acciones propuestas que permite la resolución de problemas que vuelvan a generar insumos para la construcción de nuevas demandas que surgen del territorio.
Así mismo un producto sumamente importante del sistema es justamente reducir los gastos que tienen el ámbito rural en la  dependencia de insumos, al disminuir la necesidad de antimicrobianos, agroquímicos para la producción como la importancia de alertas tempranas y de prevención de los riesgos sanitarios disminuyen los gastos innecesarios de los gobiernos en esta temáticas. Siempre es mejor prevenir que curar, a la vez que el territorio produce alimentos saludables e inocuos.
La necesidad de medir su impacto y la posibilidad de regularizarlo con los marcos analíticos de cada pais es una manera de que no solo sea sostenible sino que además se logre replicar en los distintos piases que buscan construir territorios sanos.

89968,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Isoform socket automatically adjusts to changes in amputees' leg size to maintain a consistent and comfortable fit throughout the day.,"Ilderton, ON, Canada",Canada,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>Globally, a leg is amputated every 30s and there are 50M amputees worldwide. Unfortunately, these amputees experience poor socket fit, a misfit between their residual leg and prosthetic socket causing chaffing. Thus, 16% of amputees abandon their prostheses and are unable to walk. Without their prosthesis, amputees are confined to a wheelchair, limiting the tasks of daily living they can perform independently and their ability to get sufficient exercise to stay healthy.Prosthesis abandonment costs prosthetists, leading to millions of dollars in lost revenue opportunity in the United States. </p>
<p>The gold standard for dealing with poor socket fit is sock ply management. Amputees will layer prosthetic socks beneath their socket several times a day to accommodate for their changing leg size. Unfortunately, this is difficult to learn and, if performed poorly, leads to pressure sores. Thus, prosthetists spend countless hours on sock ply education, hours for which they are not reimbursed. If sock ply management does not sufficiently solve the problem, amputees will visit their prosthetist to modify the socket, which is time consuming and only provides a temporary solution, and prosthetists are not reimbursed for those visits.</p>
<p>Globally, there are 50MM amputees and 2MM reside in the United States. Of the 185 000 amputations performed annually in the United States, 86% are lower limb. Our total addressable market is the $13B global prosthetics and orthotics market. Our serviceable addressable market are below-knee amputees in the US, a $1.8B valuation of lifelong customers, which is expected to increase. Diabetes, which is the leading cause of amputation, is experiencing 51% growth (2021-2045). Based on amputees’ eligibility for their first prosthesis and the frequency with which they get a new one, our serviceable obtainable market is $909M annually.</p>","<p>Vessl’s isoform socket is the only socket that automatically adjusts as amputees’ legs change size. Adjustable sockets on the market rely on constant manual operation, making them inaccessible to amputees with poor dexterity or sensation loss. Isoform’s automatic adjustments are more comfortable, more accessible, and reduce pressure extremes that often lead to wound development. Isoform’s patent pending technology redistributes pressure around the leg as it changes volume to maintain a snug fit. With Isoform, amputees avoid pressures extremes, so they can walk around all day comfortably while prosthetists retain their patients.</p>
<p>Our patent pending technology relies on an outer socket shell and moveable panels attached to a mechanical disc, enabling the panels to automatically contract the inner volume of the isoform socket. The level of tension of the panels on the leg is set by the prosthetist during the custom fitting process. The mechanical disc aims to maintain the set level of tension on the leg, without relying on flimsy sensors, heavy batteries, nor expensive motors. Automatic adjustments are the key feature that make our device accessible to those with poor dexterity and sensation loss because they don’t need to consciously initiate socket adjustments.</p>

Thus, our target customers are the prosthetists supporting these amputees, especially prosthetists with 5-15 years of experience who have seen the problem often and are motivated to incorporate new innovations into their practice. </p>
<p>Current limitations for prosthetic solutions lead to 16% of amputees abandoning their prosthesis altogether. Without their prosthesis, amputees are confined to a wheelchair, limiting the tasks of daily living they can perform independently and their ability to get sufficient exercise to stay healthy. With isoform, amputees can move comfortably, thereby improving their health and allowing them to remain independent longer. Also, isoform maintains a perfect fit on the leg to avoid pressure extremes on the residual limb that often lead to wound development, a key to maintaining long-term health. Long-term health is also great for workplaces, allowing employees to focus on their job without unnecessary interruptions or complications. Isoform empowers amputees to focus on their work without actively managing their limb volume changes, giving them peace of mind and allowing them to be more engaged with their community, encouraging high performance and career advancement.</p>
<p>Amputees in rural and lower income countries struggle to access prosthetic solutions at all. Isoform's automatic adjustments mean that folks in rural areas do not need to travel regularly for follow up visits and can continue to use their prosthesis, reducing the abandonment rate and increasing community engagement. Amputees in lower income countries can afford this passive system that does not rely on motors nor batteries to work, thereby increasing the socket's durability and increasing the number of folks who can access it as a solution.</p>","<p>Sydney’s background as a biomedical engineer (MEng), Oleksiy’s skills as a clinical anatomist (PhD), and their extensive entrepreneurial training set Vessl up for success.

 Provide a one-line summary of your solution.: Isoform socket automatically adjusts to changes in amputees' leg size to maintain a consistent and comfortable fit throughout the day.
 In what city, town, or region is your solution team headquartered?: Ilderton, ON, Canada
 In what country is your solution team headquartered?: Canada
 What type of organization is your solution team?: For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: nan
 What specific problem are you solving?: Globally, a leg is amputated every 30s and there are 50M amputees worldwide. Unfortunately, these amputees experience poor socket fit, a misfit between their residual leg and prosthetic socket causing chaffing. Thus, 16% of amputees abandon their prostheses and are unable to walk. Without their prosthesis, amputees are confined to a wheelchair, limiting the tasks of daily living they can perform independently and their ability to get sufficient exercise to stay healthy.Prosthesis abandonment costs prosthetists, leading to millions of dollars in lost revenue opportunity in the United States. 
The gold standard for dealing with poor socket fit is sock ply management. Amputees will layer prosthetic socks beneath their socket several times a day to accommodate for their changing leg size. Unfortunately, this is difficult to learn and, if performed poorly, leads to pressure sores. Thus, prosthetists spend countless hours on sock ply education, hours for which they are not reimbursed. If sock ply management does not sufficiently solve the problem, amputees will visit their prosthetist to modify the socket, which is time consuming and only provides a temporary solution, and prosthetists are not reimbursed for those visits.
Globally, there are 50MM amputees and 2MM reside in the United States. Of the 185 000 amputations performed annually in the United States, 86% are lower limb. Our total addressable market is the $13B global prosthetics and orthotics market. Our serviceable addressable market are below-knee amputees in the US, a $1.8B valuation of lifelong customers, which is expected to increase. Diabetes, which is the leading cause of amputation, is experiencing 51% growth (2021-2045). Based on amputees’ eligibility for their first prosthesis and the frequency with which they get a new one, our serviceable obtainable market is $909M annually.
 What is your solution?: Vessl’s isoform socket is the only socket that automatically adjusts as amputees’ legs change size. Adjustable sockets on the market rely on constant manual operation, making them inaccessible to amputees with poor dexterity or sensation loss. Isoform’s automatic adjustments are more comfortable, more accessible, and reduce pressure extremes that often lead to wound development. Isoform’s patent pending technology redistributes pressure around the leg as it changes volume to maintain a snug fit. With Isoform, amputees avoid pressures extremes, so they can walk around all day comfortably while prosthetists retain their patients.
Our patent pending technology relies on an outer socket shell and moveable panels attached to a mechanical disc, enabling the panels to automatically contract the inner volume of the isoform socket. The level of tension of the panels on the leg is set by the prosthetist during the custom fitting process. The mechanical disc aims to maintain the set level of tension on the leg, without relying on flimsy sensors, heavy batteries, nor expensive motors. Automatic adjustments are the key feature that make our device accessible to those with poor dexterity and sensation loss because they don’t need to consciously initiate socket adjustments.

 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : Our target end users are below knee amputees experiencing limb volume change, which are typically folks with diabetes in the aging population. Thus, our target customers are the prosthetists supporting these amputees, especially prosthetists with 5-15 years of experience who have seen the problem often and are motivated to incorporate new innovations into their practice. 
Current limitations for prosthetic solutions lead to 16% of amputees abandoning their prosthesis altogether. Without their prosthesis, amputees are confined to a wheelchair, limiting the tasks of daily living they can perform independently and their ability to get sufficient exercise to stay healthy. With isoform, amputees can move comfortably, thereby improving their health and allowing them to remain independent longer. Also, isoform maintains a perfect fit on the leg to avoid pressure extremes on the residual limb that often lead to wound development, a key to maintaining long-term health. Long-term health is also great for workplaces, allowing employees to focus on their job without unnecessary interruptions or complications. Isoform empowers amputees to focus on their work without actively managing their limb volume changes, giving them peace of mind and allowing them to be more engaged with their community, encouraging high performance and career advancement.
Amputees in rural and lower income countries struggle to access prosthetic solutions at all. Isoform's automatic adjustments mean that folks in rural areas do not need to travel regularly for follow up visits and can continue to use their prosthesis, reducing the abandonment rate and increasing community engagement. Amputees in lower income countries can afford this passive system that does not rely on motors nor batteries to work, thereby increasing the socket's durability and increasing the number of folks who can access it as a solution.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: Sydney’s background as a biomedical engineer (MEng), Oleksiy’s skills as a clinical anatomist (PhD), and their extensive entrepreneurial training set Vessl up for success. They have extensive prototyping, research and end-user design experience from building research projects from the ground up. The Medical Innovation Fellowship trained them in medical device development and entrepreneurship. Vessl’s luminary advisors bring unique insights and experiences that are invaluable to the team. Ben Banaszak is a practicing prosthetist in New York with a background in biomaterials engineering, while Trey Bowles is a successful serial entrepreneur and Jim Price’s new products have generated nearly $1B in sales. Other key advisors who are close to our target communities are Josh, whose PhD is in prosthetics and who owns two prosthetics consulting and research-based companies, and Geoff, a double leg amputee whose worked for many prosthetic companies as a socket tester and in sales. Vessl is also supported by several incubators: Techstars Physical Health Fort Worth, Brampton Venture Zone, Velocity, Western Accelerator, BioNext, and Accelerator Centre.
 Which dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address?: Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).
 Which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals does your solution address?: 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 10. Reduced Inequalities
 What is your solution’s stage of development?: Prototype
 Please share details about why you selected the stage above.: We have a working prototype that we are mechanically testing for strngeth and durability before it is worn by amputees. We have conducted problem validation with customers (prosthetists, 160) and users (amputees, 75), which proved that limb volume change is a critical problem that current solutions do not adequately address. We conduct regular surveys and voice of customer engagements to answer critical market and design validation questions. We are working with amputees and prosthetists from 5 healthcare centres at the American Veterans Health Administration on product validation. There are two parts to our engagement: 4 one-hour video calls where prosthetists and amputees can provide feedback on our design and recommendations for the future, and an in-person demonstration of our prototype after changes are made based on the added insights they provide. We will use this feedback to inform our design and strengthen our data supporting the need for our solution. We were also accepted into Mitacs’ E-Accelerate program to work with Western University on product validation and testing. Lastly, we were accepted into the Hamilton Ecosystem to Accelerate and Leverage Trials of Health Innovation (HEALTHI) program. We are working with St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton to create a clinical case study roadmap to guide research and validation of our socket. Throughout all of these opportunities, we are actively involving the customer and end user in the design process. As an engineer taught about the critical nature of end-user design, it is something we are actively focused on.
 Why are you applying to Solve?: We applied to Solve to expand our network globally and attract research partners. Our next major milestones include clinical research and U.S. product launch. For clinical research, we have identified several potential partners and spoke to several prosthetists about what tests they want to see so that the outcomes collected are relevant to their decision making process. For product launch, we are building relationships with 23 clinics servicing 7500 below knee amputees. We will register with the FDA (medical device class 1) in Q3 to prepare for launch in Q4. The funds will be critical in securing manufacturing contracts in advantageous geographical locations (centered around the southern states, eastern states, and California where reimbursement rates and rates of amputation are highest). Therefore, Solve's network across the world would be critical in connecting us with high impact partners. We want to help folks displaced by the civil unrest un Ukraine, Israel, and other countries, which Solve can help with. We also want to work with respected researchers in the United States to conduct research to support our claims.
 In which of the following areas do you most need partners or support?: Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Human Capital (e.g. sourcing talent, board development), Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact), Product / Service Distribution (e.g. delivery, logistics, expanding client base), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)
 Who is the Team Lead for your solution?: Sydney Robinson
 Is the Team Lead a resident of the United States?: No
 Have you or someone else from your organization ever been selected as a Solver for an MIT Solve Global Challenge or for the Indigenous Communities Fellowship?: No
 Explain what makes your solution different from when you or your organization was previously selected.: nan
 Is your solution an active or past participant in another entrepreneurship network? : Yes, this solution is already (or has been in the past) a part of other networks
 Please share the names of the other entrepreneurship networks.: Vessl is supported by several incubators: Techstars Physical Health Fort Worth, Brampton Venture Zone, Velocity, Western Accelerator, BioNext, and Accelerator Centre.
 Did you take the MITx course “Business and Impact Planning for Social Enterprises?” : No, I didn’t take the course
 How did you first hear about Solve?: Google or other search engine
 Tell us more about how you found out about Solve’s 2024 Global Challenges.: I researched opportunities to propel my company and product validation forward and came across Solve in my search.
 What makes your solution innovative?: Our device is automatically adjusting; it overcomes the barriers many amputees face to using currently available adjustable sockets, especially the aging population. Therefore, it is easier to use than the status quo. It is also more comfortable because it automatically adjusts to minute changes in limb volume. It will not disrupt prosthetists' workflow, which is a current barrier to prosthetists choosing to adopt the existing products. Our device also allows for an increased degree of adjustability to accommodate a wider range of limb volume changes through precise microadjustments, again making it more accessible to a wider range of end users.For leg amputees who struggle with poor socket fit due to residual limb volume changes, Vessl’s Isoform socket automatically adjusts to changes in leg size to maintain a comfortable fit, encouraging amputees to wear their prosthesis and engage in activities of daily living. Continued prosthesis use also allows prosthetists to continue to fabricate sockets over the amputee’s lifetime, instead of making one prosthesis that is quickly abandoned. For prosthetists who spend countless hours on non-billable socket adjustments, Vessl’s Isoform socket eliminates the need for socket adjustments, thereby allowing prosthetists to focus their time on billable tasks.There are two reasons our business is hard to duplicate. For one, we protected our intellectual property early on by patenting our designs with broad claims. This will deter competitors from creating copies of our isoform socket design. The other reason is perspective; our co-founders are not prosthetists so while we are designing a solution for prosthetists, our creativity is not hindered by a narrow way of thinking from decades of experience in the field. Rather, we bring expert insights from engineering and clinical anatomy with a passion for designing for our customer and end user, ultimately creating an easy to use and clinically relevant solution.This product has the opportunity to disrupt the prosthetic industry and become the new gold standard socket prescribed to every lower limb amputee.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: We have conducted problem validation with customers (prosthetists, 160) and users (amputees, 75), which proved that limb volume change is a critical problem that current solutions do not adequately address.

As an engineer taught about the critical nature of end-user design, it is something we are actively focused on.To date, we have 6 signed letters of intent from prosthetists and 3 signed letters of support from other key stakeholders. We have also begun engaging with 5 Veterans Affairs healthcare centers on product validation, filed two patents, conducted pressure-sensor testing with a custom-made demo limb, have a dozen amputees on our waitlist, and have raised over $1M CAD in dilutive and non-dilutive funding combined.In one year, we aim to sell 62 isoform sockets and in 5 years, this grows to 38K isoform sockets sold, positively impacting thousands of amputees’ lives, and thousands more prosthetists, caregivers and community members. Current sockets are abandoned by 16% of users due to frustration and pain. Without their prosthesis, amputees are confined to a wheelchair, limiting the tasks of daily living they can perform independently and their ability to get sufficient exercise to stay healthy. With isoform, amputees can move comfortably, thereby improving their health and allowing them to remain independent longer. Long-term health is also great for workplaces, allowing employees to focus on their job without unnecessary interruptions or complications. Isoform empowers amputees to focus on their work without actively managing their limb volume changes, giving them peace of mind and allowing them to be more engaged with their work community, encouraging high performance and career advancement.

 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: Our patent pending technology relies on an outer socket shell and moveable panels attached to a mechanical disc, enabling the panels to automatically contract the inner volume of the isoform socket. The level of tension of the panels on the leg is set by the prosthetist during the custom fitting process. The mechanical disc aims to maintain the set level of tension on the leg, without relying on flimsy sensors, heavy batteries, nor expensive motors. Automatic adjustments are the key feature that make our device accessible to those with poor dexterity and sensation loss because they don’t need to consciously initiate socket adjustments.

The disparities in health service delivery across the African continent underscore the broader issues of access, quality and financial burden faced by rural communities. The extent of this problem is huge with 51.7% of the population across the African continent residing in rural areas, with up to 80% facing geographical difficulties in accessing modern healthcare.</p>
<p>In South Africa, where 31.6% of the population live in rural areas, the health system is plagued by systemic and structural challenges that result in suboptimal care levels and patient management. The impact that this has upon the healthcare of individuals living in rural, chronically underserved areas is pervasive and has been best highlighted by our own experience working in South Africa’s O.R. Tambo district in the Eastern Cape. Due to the high rates of poverty (65.5% of the population are living in poverty) and rurality (O.R. Tambo is categorised as a category C2 municipality, indicating a largely rural character and low urbanisation rate, as well as limited municipal staff and budget capacity) families and communities face considerable challenges in ensuring that their children access quality health care and treatment. </p>
<p>Firstly, medical facilities (government clinics and hospitals) are often characterised by stock outs and severe personal shortages, whilst also being too far to access by foot and too expensive to access by public transport. In 2020 for example, there was one doctor serving a catchment area of 140,000 people at Canzibe hospital in the Eastern Cape, in addition to no dedicated ambulance service.</p>
<p>Secondly, for many individuals their critical health data, which is essential for prevention or management of a patient's health, is not collected nor analysed. For example, although there are a plethora of antenatal risks, key data is not tracked, which can impact both maternal and child mortality rates, whilst individuals exposed or living with HIV are not tracked leading to HIV acquisition or loss to follow up. This is due to poor paper-based data collection tools, and shortages in staffing, including health workers who can access beneficiaries in the community.</p>
<p>As a result of these circumstances, thousands of individuals, especially women and children, miss out on the critical health services needed for their health, such as vaccinations, HIV/TB testing, ART treatment, and nutritional assessments. In fact, the leading cause of death for children below the age of 5 years is diarrheal diseases at 26.3% of total deaths followed by lower respiratory diseases at 17.0% in that age group. HIV/AIDS also accounts for 17% of under-five deaths, and over a quarter of children are not receiving potentially life-saving vaccines (SAgov, 2020).</p>","<p>One to One Africa’s Enable programme has operated in South Africa’s Eastern Cape Province, O.R. Tambo district since 2016, addressing the interlinkages between poverty, infrastructure and poor health. The key to our unique model is that it brings healthcare out of the clinic and into last mile communities to provide proactive not reactive care. At the heart of our model are Mentors, who are trained individuals from the community they serve, and are recruited, trained and equipped to provide local women and men to offer a comprehensive range of health services at the community level. Their work includes providing prenatal and postnatal care, managing chronic diseases, giving nutrition advice and facilitating access to immunisations. These Mentors become a trusted resource, bridging the gap between the community and healthcare facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>To bolster our efforts, we are focused on enhancing our existing mHealth app, to feature real-time health metrics, predictive analytics, diagnostic assistance and a triaging system, alongside expanding our mobile health operations. Together, these initiatives will enable us to deliver efficient and effective health services to individuals in the hardest-to-reach areas across South Africa</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Mobile clinic contingent: </em></strong>One to One Africa deploys mobile clinics that are uniquely designed to reach individuals in the most inaccessible areas. Complementing the work of our Mentors, our mobile clinics stand at the forefront of our efforts to penetrate the most inaccessible terrains. These clinics are not just vehicles of care; they are lifelines, delivering education on critical health matters, fostering preventive health behaviours, ensuring emergency care availability, and conducting essential health screenings. These mobile clinics hit the ground running, fully equipped with the necessary tools and staff—including Mentors, a nurse, a data capturer, and a driver—to make an immediate and profound impact on the communities they reach. The clinics are pivotal in disseminating knowledge on pressing health concerns like TB, HIV, and measles, instigating behaviour change towards health-seeking actions, providing basic screenings, and offering essential medical services. This initiative is particularly vital in areas devoid of any other healthcare facilities or community health workers, filling a critical gap in the health ecosystem of the regions we serve.</p>
<p><strong><em>mHealth app:</em></strong> One to One Africa's mobile health solution, developed in partnership with mHealth specialists Dimagi, comprises a sophisticated application designed for frontline healthcare workers. This tool significantly enhances the regular collection and management of data, streamlining service delivery and boosting its effectiveness. In order to enhance our service offering, especially for clients that we access through our mobile clinic, there is a critical need for an advanced version of the application that can predict an individual's risk of developing specific health conditions and effectively triage complex and priority cases for treatment. This will both reduce the number of health conditions necessitating response and prioritisation of those that do, ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality rates across rural South Africa. This approach is particularly vital for mobile clinics operating in remote areas, where long distances and limited staff necessitate maximised efficiency in healthcare provision.</p>","<p>Through this project, One to One Africa seeks to serve individuals who live in the poorest and most remote regions of South Africa’s Eastern Cape, prior to expansion to similar populations across South Africa. The majority of these individuals live in poverty (approximately 67% of the population in rural Eastern Cape live below poverty line), with high levels of unemployment and low rates of educational attainment. </p>
<p>These marginalised communities, often situated in the remotest areas, experience the poorest access to substandard healthcare services that fail to meet national expectations. As such individuals living in these regions have notably poorer health outcomes due to systemic and structural deficiencies in healthcare service delivery. Research from the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) highlights that in rural northern KwaZulu-Natal, for instance, four out of five women over the age of 30 suffer from chronic health conditions. Whilst in South Africa’s rural Eastern Cape in particular, the prevalence of infectious diseases, chronic conditions, and malnutrition exceeds the national average, while immunisation coverage and healthcare service quality remain the country’s lowest.</p>

<p><i>Integration of Mobile and Digital Technologies: The combination of mobile health clinics with an advanced mHealth application leverages the strengths of both physical and digital healthcare solutions. This integrated approach is relatively rare in healthcare provisioning, especially in rural or underdeveloped areas. It allows for a flexible, responsive healthcare service that can reach individuals who are otherwise isolated from traditional healthcare systems due to geographical and economic barriers.</i></p>
<p><i>Real-time Data Utilisation: The use of real-time health metrics and predictive analytics in the mHealth app is innovative because it allows for immediate, data-driven decision-making. This capability can transform how healthcare is delivered by enabling early detection and intervention for high-risk patients, thereby potentially reducing the severity of illnesses and improving overall health outcomes. Predictive analytics can foresee the likelihood of diseases based on patterns, significantly benefiting areas where disease burden is high and healthcare resources are stretched thin.</i></p>
<p><i>Localised Healthcare Delivery: The deployment of mobile clinics staffed by community members (Mentors) who are familiar with the local context, culture, and specific health challenges is innovative in its community-centred approach. This model fosters trust and improves the effectiveness of health communication and interventions, making it more likely that individuals will seek and adhere to medical advice and treatments.</i></p>
<p><i>Comprehensive Care Provisioning: The mobile clinics do not merely provide basic healthcare but offer a comprehensive range of services, from prenatal and postnatal care to chronic disease management and emergency response. This holistic approach addresses the spectrum of healthcare needs in a single visit, which is critical in areas where patients may have limited opportunities to seek care.</i></p>
<p><i>Scalability and Replicability: The model’s design considers scalability and adaptability to different rural contexts, not just within South Africa but potentially across other regions of Africa facing similar healthcare delivery challenges. The lessons learned and data collected from these initiatives can inform broader policies and practices, enhancing healthcare delivery in other low-resource settings.</i></p>
<p><i>Partnerships for Enhanced Capacity: Collaborating with technology and health experts like Dimagi for the development of the mHealth app ensures that the solution is grounded in cutting-edge technology and best practices in healthcare. These partnerships help build a robust platform that can continually be improved based on feedback and evolving healthcare needs.</i></p>
<p><i>The innovative nature of this solution lies in its ability to effectively combine technology with human-centred service delivery, creating a model that is adaptable, scalable, and capable of significantly improving health outcomes in some of the most challenging environments. This approach addresses not only the symptoms of inadequate healthcare infrastructure but also the systemic issues that underlie health disparities in rural South Africa</i></p>","<p>Our solution's expected impact on the problem of healthcare accessibility and quality in rural areas is grounded in a robust theory of change, which integrates proven intervention strategies with innovative technologies. The theory posits that by merging mobile healthcare delivery with advanced AI-driven data analytics, we can substantially improve health outcomes for underserved populations.</p>
<p>Starting Point and Historical Success:</p>
<p>Our initiative is based on the foundational success of the Mentor Mother Model, which has already demonstrated significant efficacy in improving health outcomes. Internal evaluations and published research indicate that through this model, 70% of clients adhere to antiretroviral therapies, over 50% of children access grants, and more than 80% of underweight children are successfully rehabilitated. These outcomes are pivotal, showing that direct, community-based health interventions can substantially reduce health inequalities and enhance overall well-being.</p>
<p>Integration of AI and Mobile Clinics:</p>
<p>The integration of AI into our mobile clinics is a strategic advancement that builds on this existing framework. By processing vast amounts of health data in real-time, AI algorithms can predict individuals' risk of developing severe health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer. This capability is crucial in rural areas where healthcare resources are limited, and early intervention can radically alter patient outcomes. As healthcare workers input patient data into our mHealth applications, AI models assess risk factors on the spot and provide tailored recommendations for preventive measures and management strategies. This not only enhances the precision of healthcare delivery but also ensures that interventions are proactive and targeted.</p>
<p>Impact Through Predictive Algorithms:</p>
<p>Predictive algorithms further revolutionize the triage process by identifying patients who need urgent medical intervention, prioritizing them based on the severity and urgency of their conditions. This is especially critical in remote areas, where traditional healthcare delivery might be delayed or inaccessible. By ensuring that mobile clinics are dispatched to areas with the most pressing needs, we not only maximize the effectiveness of healthcare delivery but also optimize the allocation of scarce medical resources.</p>
<p>Broad and Strategic Deployment:</p>
<p>Our approach ensures that the most critical health issues are addressed first, improving health outcomes by providing immediate care to those most at risk. The predictive capabilities of our AI tools also allow for the strategic prioritization and deployment of mobile clinics, enhancing overall service efficiency in remote and underserved regions.</p>
<p>Long-term Impact:</p>
<p>In the long run, this integrated approach not only reduces the prevalence of severe health conditions but also builds a more equitable healthcare system that bridges the gap between rural and urban health services. By scaling this model and ensuring its adaptability to various rural contexts, we aim to replicate its success across other regions, potentially transforming healthcare delivery on a broader scale.</p>
<p>Thus, our theory of change asserts that through the innovative use of mobile health clinics enhanced with AI technology, we can achieve a sustainable improvement in health equity, significantly reducing morbidity and mortality among the most vulnerable populations in South Africa and beyond.</p>","<p>Our impact goals are as follows:-</p>
<p>Increased Healthcare Access: Our primary goal is to expand access to quality healthcare services for individuals living in remote and underserved areas of rural South Africa. By deploying mobile clinics equipped with advanced digital technologies, we aim to bridge the accessibility gap, ensuring that essential healthcare reaches those who need it most.</p>
<p>Improved Health Outcomes: We strive to enhance the overall health status of the rural population by reducing the incidence of preventable diseases, effectively managing chronic conditions, and improving maternal and child health metrics. The proactive and preventive nature of our healthcare services is designed to address health issues before they escalate.</p>
<p>Reduced Morbidity and Mortality: Through early detection, preventive care, and timely treatment enabled by our mobile clinics and AI-enhanced mHealth app, we aim to lower the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with both communicable and non-communicable diseases in rural regions.</p>
<p>Healthcare System Integration: Our solution seeks to integrate seamlessly with the existing healthcare infrastructure to ensure a coordinated and sustained approach to rural health. This integration is crucial for maintaining continuity of care and optimizing the impact of healthcare interventions across different service points.</p>
<p>Methods of Measuring Progress.</p>
<p>Service Delivery Metrics: We will track the number of healthcare visits, patient interactions, and specific services delivered (e.g., vaccinations, screenings, prenatal consultations) via the mobile clinics. These metrics will be compared over time to assess how effectively the solution is expanding healthcare access.</p>
<p>Health Outcome Indicators: Key health indicators such as rates of immunization, antenatal care coverage, and reduction in the incidence of diseases like HIV, TB, and malaria will be monitored. These indicators will be collected through our mHealth app and verified during follow-up visits, providing a quantitative measure of health improvements.</p>
<p>Data Analytics: The predictive analytics and data management features of the mHealth app will be utilized to analyse health trends and outcomes. This analysis will offer insights into the effectiveness of our interventions and help identify areas where improvements are needed.</p>
<p>Patient Surveys and Feedback: Regular surveys and feedback collection from patients and healthcare workers will be conducted to evaluate satisfaction levels and the perceived quality of care. This qualitative data is essential for gauging the human impact of our solution and for making patient-centred improvements.</p>
<p>Collaboration with Local Health Authorities: We will work in partnership with local health departments and agencies to ensure data sharing and alignment with national health goals. This collaboration is vital for measuring the broader impact of our initiative on public health systems.</p>
<p>Sustainability Metrics: The sustainability of our healthcare model will be evaluated by assessing factors like cost-effectiveness, resource utilisation, and the ongoing training of community health workers. These metrics will help ensure that our solution is not only effective but also sustainable in the long term.</p>
<p>By diligently monitoring these metrics, we aim to ensure that we not only meets the immediate healthcare needs of rural populations but contribute to sustainable improvements in health outcomes and reduction in health disparities across.</p>","<p>The core technology that powers the solution provided by One to One Africa is centred around an advanced mobile health (mHealth) application developed in partnership with mHealth specialists like Dimagi. This application is designed to be used by frontline healthcare workers operating in mobile clinics across rural areas. Here's a detailed description of the primary technological components and functionalities of this mHealth application:</p>
<p>Real-Time Health Metrics: The app collects and processes health data from patients in real-time. This includes vital signs, patient history, symptom tracking, and other relevant health indicators. The ability to access and analyse this information on-the-go enables healthcare workers to make informed decisions quickly.</p>
<p>Predictive Analytics: Utilising machine learning algorithms, the app analyses the gathered data to predict health risks and outcomes. For instance, it can forecast the likelihood of a patient developing chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease based on their medical history, lifestyle choices, and genetic predispositions. This predictive capability is crucial for proactive healthcare management and early intervention.</p>
<p>Diagnostic Assistance: The app provides decision support tools to help healthcare workers diagnose a range of conditions effectively. It might include guideline-based recommendations, differential diagnoses, and suggested treatment plans tailored to individual patient profiles.</p>
<p>Triaging System: The application incorporates a triaging protocol to prioritise patients based on the severity and urgency of their conditions. This feature ensures that those who require immediate care can receive it promptly and efficiently, which is particularly vital in settings with limited resources.</p>
<p>Data Management and Integration: The app ensures that all patient data is securely stored and can be easily accessed by authorised personnel. This facilitates a seamless flow of information and allows for effective long-term health management. Integration capabilities with other health systems and databases enable a comprehensive approach to patient care across different service points.</p>

Our major plan to ensure this is the uptake of our Mentor Mother model by the South African Department of Health. We have already trained and supervised 27 Department of Health Community Health Workers (CHWs) to deliver services in the O.R Tambo district and are in agreement with the DoH to solidify and expand this work over the next three years through capacity building and technical support. This will be achieved through: -</p>
<ol><li><p>Training of Trainers (ToT): One To One Africa will Train-the-Trainers (ToT) who will provide training to CHWs in their respective provinces and districts. The Training-of-Trainers (ToT) forms the basis of integrating the life saving impact of the Enable programme into DoH’s CHW strategy and community public health provision strategy. The training entails learning, understanding, observation in action, practising and ultimately teaching others about the Mentor Model. Once piloted and validated, the additional components (articulated earlier above) will be integrated into the Mentor Mother curriculum.

This hybrid approach has the potential to unlock new frontiers in diagnostic accuracy, enabling earlier detection of rare and complex diseases and reducing the risk of harmful diagnostic errors.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our innovation goes beyond just the technological breakthroughs. We are also pioneering a new model for developing and deploying AI in healthcare, prioritizing transparency, trust, and equity. We are committed to building our solution in close collaboration with the communities we serve, engaging patients, providers, and advocates as co-designers and co-owners of the technology. By democratizing access to cutting-edge diagnostic tools and ensuring that the benefits of innovation are shared equitably, we aim to shift power dynamics and promote a more inclusive and participatory approach to healthcare innovation.
</p>
<p> The potential impact of DiagnosisAid extends far beyond the immediate benefits to patients and providers. We can catalyze broader adoption of this transformative technology across the industry by demonstrating the feasibility and implications of quantum AI in healthcare. Our success could inspire other innovators to explore the applications of quantum computing in drug discovery, personalized medicine, and beyond, accelerating progress and unlocking new possibilities for human health and well-being.
</p>
<p>Moreover, by reducing the burden of misdiagnosis on healthcare systems, DiagnosisAid could help to free up scarce resources and expertise to focus on other pressing challenges, such as expanding access to care, improving population health, and addressing the social determinants of health. Our solution can be a force multiplier for positive change, empowering healthcare leaders and policymakers to tackle systemic inequities and drive transformative impact at scale.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, DiagnosisAid represents a new paradigm for approaching the challenge of diagnosis in healthcare. By combining cutting-edge technology with a deep commitment to social justice and community empowerment, we are poised to change the landscape of healthcare innovation and create a future where everyone can access the lifesaving power of accurate, timely, and personalized diagnosis. Our vision is not just to build a better diagnostic tool but to catalyze a movement for health equity and to inspire a new generation of innovators to tackle the world's most pressing challenges with courage, compassion, and creativity.</p>","<p>At DiagnosisAid, we have developed a clear theory of change that links our activities to immediate outputs and longer-term outcomes for our target population of underserved patients and healthcare providers. Our approach is grounded in a solid evidence base and a deep understanding of the complex factors contributing to the global misdiagnosis burden.</p>
<p>Our core activity is developing and deploying a quantum AI-powered diagnostic support tool that integrates seamlessly into clinical workﬂows. By leveraging the power of quantum computing and machine learning, our solution is designed to process vast amounts of patient data and generate highly accurate and personalized diagnostic insights in real-time. This technology is complemented by a user-friendly interface and intuitive visualizations that make it easy for clinicians to interpret and act on the information provided.
</p>
<p>The immediate output of this activity is a significant improvement in the speed, accuracy, and consistency of diagnostic decision-making. By providing clinicians with rapid access to evidence-based insights and reducing the cognitive burden of complex cases, DiagnosisAid enables providers to make more informed and conﬁdent diagnoses at the point of care. This is supported by extensive research showing that AI-assisted diagnosis can improve diagnostic accuracy by up to 25% compared to unassisted clinicians, particularly in challenging cases such as rare diseases or atypical presentations (Topol, 2019; Liu et al., 2019).
</p>
<p>In the short term, this improved diagnostic performance will translate into positive outcomes for patients and providers. For patients, the faster and more accurate diagnosis means earlier initiation of appropriate treatment, reducing the risk of complications and improving overall health outcomes. This is particularly important for conditions where early detection is critical, such as cancer or infectious diseases. </p>
<p>Over the longer term, DiagnosisAid can drive transformative change in the healthcare landscape by reducing the systemic burden of misdiagnosis. Studies have shown that diagnostic errors contribute to over 100,000 deaths and $100 billion in wasted healthcare spending each year in the US alone (Singh et al., 2014). By preventing a significant portion of these errors, our solution could help to reduce preventable mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs at a population level. This is supported by modeling studies suggesting that even a 5% reduction in diagnostic error rates could save thousands of lives and billions of dollars annually (Newman-Toker et al., 2019).
</p>
<p>Critically, we believe that the impact of DiagnosisAid will be most pronounced among underserved and marginalized communities who currently bear the most significant burden of diagnostic inequity. Research has consistently shown that patients from racial and ethnic minorities, low-income backgrounds, and rural areas experience higher rates of misdiagnosis and diagnostic delay (Shen et al., 2019). By partnering with community health centers and safety-net providers to deploy our solution in these settings, we aim to narrow these disparities and ensure that the benefits of diagnostic innovation are shared equitably.
</p>
<p>To support and amplify these outcomes, we are committed to a participatory approach that engages patients, providers, and community stakeholders as active partners in developing and evaluating our solution. </p>","<p>At DiagnosisAid, our impact goals are centered around our mission to revolutionize global access to accurate, timely, and equitable medical diagnosis through the power of quantum AI. We have developed a set of speciﬁc, measurable, and time-bound goals that orient all aspects of our work and hold us accountable to the communities we serve.</p>
<p>Our primary impact goal is to reduce the global burden of misdiagnosis by 50% within the next ten years. This ambitious target is grounded in recognizing that diagnostic errors are a silent epidemic that affects millions of patients worldwide, with devastating consequences for individual and population health. </p>
<p>We are tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) that capture our solution's reach, eﬀectiveness, and equity to measure our progress towards this goal. These include:
</p>
<p>1. Diagnostic Accuracy: We are measuring the percentage of cases where DiagnosisAid's top suggested diagnosis matches the ﬁnal conﬁrmed diagnosis compared to unassisted clinicians. We aim to achieve a 30% improvement in diagnostic accuracy within 2 years of deployment at Native American and urban hospitals that mainly serve people of color.
</p>
<p> 2. Time to Diagnosis: We are tracking the average time from initial presentation to ﬁnal diagnosis for patients who use DiagnosisAid, compared to standard care. Our goal is to reduce the time to diagnosis by 25% within the first year of deployment.
</p>
<p>3. Patient Outcomes: We monitor a range of patient-centered outcomes, such as mortality rates, complication rates, and quality of life scores, for conditions where misdiagnosis is common. We aim to demonstrate a measurable improvement in these outcomes within five years of deployment.
</p>
<p>4. Health Equity: We are measuring the adoption and impact of DiagnosisAid across diverse patient populations, focusing on underserved communities. We aim to ensure that at least 50% of our users come from low-income, minority, or rural backgrounds within three years of deployment.
</p>
<p>5. Cost Savings: We are tracking the estimated healthcare costs avoided by preventing diagnostic errors and the associated complications. We aim to demonstrate a 10:1 return on investment for healthcare systems within five years of deployment.
</p>
<p>We are leveraging various data sources and evaluation methods to collect these indicators. These include electronic health record data, claims data, patient-reported outcomes, and qualitative feedback from providers and patients. Academic institutions and research organizations will partner with us to conduct rigorous studies on the impact of our solution, including randomized controlled trials and health economic evaluations. We are also committed to transparency and accountability, regularly sharing our impact data with our stakeholders and the broader public.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our impact goals are not just numbers on a page – they represent our unwavering commitment to improving the lives of patients and providers worldwide. We aim to catalyze a global movement towards diagnostic excellence and health equity by setting bold targets and holding ourselves accountable to measurable results. We believe that by harnessing the power of innovation, collaboration, and data-driven decision-making, we can create a future where everyone can access the lifesaving power of accurate and timely diagnosis.
</p>","<p>At the heart of DiagnosisAid is a revolutionary quantum AI platform combining cutting-edge advances in quantum computing, machine learning, and medical informatics to transform how we approach diagnostic decision-making.</p>
<p>The foundation of our technology is a custom-built quantum computing architecture that leverages the unique properties of quantum systems to perform complex computations at an unprecedented scale and speed. Unlike classical computers, which rely on binary bits that can only be in one state at a time (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or ""qubits"" that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a phenomenon known as superposition. This allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations, such as optimization and simulation, exponentially faster than even the most influential classical supercomputers.
</p>
<p> Our team has developed proprietary algorithms that harness the power of quantum computing to process and analyze vast amounts of medical data in previously impossible ways. These algorithms are designed to identify complex patterns and relationships across multiple data modalities, including clinical notes, lab results, imaging studies, and genomic data. Leveraging techniques such as quantum annealing and quantum machine learning can generate highly accurate and personalized diagnostic insights.</p>
<p>We have curated one of the world's most extensive and diverse medical knowledge and patient information datasets to train our quantum AI models. This includes structured and unstructured data from electronic health records, clinical trials, scientific literature, expert consensus guidelines, and real-world evidence from millions of patient encounters across various geographic and demographic contexts.</p>
<p>Another key innovation of our technology is integrating quantum simulation and counterfactual reasoning into the diagnostic process. Using advanced quantum algorithms, we can generate and test millions of hypothetical patient scenarios in parallel, allowing us to explore the full range of potential diagnoses and treatment options for each case. This enables us to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the available evidence and the most eﬀective and personalized management strategy for each patient.
</p>
<p>To make this powerful technology accessible and usable for clinicians at the point of care, we have developed an intuitive and user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates with existing clinical workﬂows and electronic health record systems. Our platform uses natural language processing and voice recognition to allow clinicians to input patient data and receive diagnostic recommendations in real-time without disrupting their everyday clinical routines. </p>
<p>Importantly, we have designed our quantum AI platform with a strong emphasis on safety, security, and ethical considerations. We have implemented rigorous data governance and privacy protection measures to ensure that patient information is always kept conﬁdential and secure. We have also developed a robust framework for algorithmic transparency and accountability, including regular audits and validation studies to assess the performance and fairness of our models across diﬀerent patient populations.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, our core technology represents a paradigm shift in approaching medical diagnosis and decision-making. Our vision is to create a future where every patient, regardless of background or location, can benefit from the most advanced and eﬀective diagnostic tools powered by cutting-edge quantum and AI technology.

This results in delayed diagnoses, suboptimal treatment plans, and poorer patient outcomes [3].</li></ul>
<p><b>Scale of the Problem:</b></p>
<ul><li><b>Global:</b> The World Health Organization estimates that globally, unsafe healthcare practices are responsible for 4.2 million deaths annually [1].</li><li><b>Africa:</b> Studies suggest that medical errors contribute to a significant portion of healthcare-associated deaths in Africa, with estimates ranging from 5% to 10% [2]. Limited access to specialists further exacerbates this issue.</li></ul>
<p><b>Factors Addressed by Tel Med:</b></p>
<ul><li><b>Lack of Collaboration:</b> Tel Med Africa fosters real-time collaboration among doctors, enabling them to share knowledge, discuss complex cases, and arrive at more informed diagnoses and treatment plans. This collaborative environment has the potential to significantly reduce medical errors.</li><li><b>Limited Access to Specialists:</b> The platform empowers geographically dispersed doctors, particularly those in underserved areas, to access specialist consultations and insights from a wider network of medical professionals. This can significantly improve patient care options, especially in remote locations.</li></ul>

Among these factors, securing shelter stands out as the most fundamental human need.

<p>Presently, there lacks a comprehensive resource where individuals in need of housing can access information, explore available affordable housing options, and track submitted applications. Moreover, many housing opportunities are complex to navigate and inaccessible to those without access to transportation and printing facilities.

Additionally, there is no streamlined process for applying to privately operated housing options, further exacerbating the challenges faced by individuals seeking stable housing.</p>
<p>Accessing these privately operated affordable housing opportunities requires individuals to either visit in person to obtain an application or send a self-addressed stamped envelope with sufficient postage (and correct envelope size) to receive the lengthy application by mail. While this process may seem straightforward, merely obtaining the application poses a significant barrier for many in need who lack transportation, lack the necessary information to procure the correct resources for receiving the application by mail, and/or lack the resources to complete and return the application (literacy, native language, etc.). State and federal affordable housing options can be applied for online in many states presently, however, information about completing all the steps required  to remain on the waitlist each year is not clear. Consequently, many applicants for these programs inadvertently forfeit their place on the waiting list due to failure to submit required documentation or respond to unexpected correspondence requiring responses.</p>","<p>Housing4All will provide the education and resources needed to access housing options for individuals in need, and provide a centralized database for community workers to update and maintain housing related information. </p>

<p><br /></p>","<p>Our solution aims to address the pressing issue of housing insecurity, recognizing its profound impact on both physical and mental health outcomes. Housing insecurity refers to the lack of stable and affordable housing, which can lead to a range of negative health consequences for individuals and communities. We do know how interlinked are housing issues and health outcomes, housing is one of the main factors of social determinants of health which has a strong influence on health. </p>
<ul><li><p>Physical Health Impacts: Housing insecurity can exacerbate existing health conditions and contribute to the development of new health problems. Individuals living in unstable housing situations may face overcrowding, exposure to environmental toxins, and inadequate access to healthcare services. These conditions increase the risk of respiratory illnesses, infectious diseases, and chronic health conditions such as asthma and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the stress and uncertainty associated with housing instability can weaken the immune system and exacerbate mental health conditions, further compromising overall health.</p></li><li><p>Mental Health Impacts: Housing insecurity is closely linked to poor mental health outcomes, including increased stress, anxiety, and depression. The uncertainty of not knowing where one will sleep at night or whether they will be able to afford rent can take a significant toll on individuals' mental well-being. Chronic stressors associated with housing insecurity can contribute to mood disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, children growing up in unstable housing environments may experience developmental delays, academic struggles, and long-term emotional trauma, impacting their mental health and future prospects.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Social Determinants of Health: Social determinants of health, such as housing, education, employment, and access to healthcare, play a critical role in shaping individuals' health outcomes and overall quality of life. Stable and affordable housing provides a sense of security and stability that is essential for individuals to prioritize their health and well-being.</p></li></ul>
<p>In summary, housing insecurity has far-reaching implications for both physical and mental health outcomes, highlighting the importance of addressing social determinants of health factors to ensure the well-being of individuals and communities. By providing access to affordable housing options and supportive resources, our solution aims to mitigate the negative health impacts of housing insecurity and promote health equity for all members of society. Through collaboration with community partners and ongoing evaluation, we seek to create lasting improvements in health outcomes and foster thriving, resilient communities.</p>","<p>Our impact goals for our solution are centered around creating tangible improvements in the lives of individuals in need of affordable housing options and related resources. We aspire to achieve the following impact goals:</p>
<ul><li><p>Increased Access to Affordable Housing: Our primary goal is to increase access to affordable housing options for individuals and families facing housing insecurity. We aim to connect users with a diverse range of affordable housing opportunities, including subsidized housing programs, and affordable homeownership options.</p></li><li><p>Better understanding through Education: We seek to empower users by providing them with educational resources and tools to make informed decisions about their housing options. Through our platform, users can access educational videos that would guide them in understanding the process  and options for them.</p></li><li><p>Streamlined Application Processes: We aim to simplify and streamline the application processes for affordable housing programs and resources. By providing downloadable forms, applications, and informational materials, we aim to reduce barriers to access and facilitate the application process for users.</p></li><li><p>Community Engagement and Support: Our solution aims at creating community engagement and support networks for individuals facing housing insecurity. We want to ultimately facilitate connections between users, housing advocates, and community organizations to provide support, resources, and assistance throughout the search and application process.</p></li></ul>

<p><strong>SMS Alerts</strong>: To enhance accessibility and reach users who may not have access to the internet, we implement SMS technology to provide alerts and notifications. Users can register with us and opt to receive alerts via SMS, ensuring they stay informed about available housing options, updates, and relevant resources. This technology enables us to reach a wider audience and provide essential information directly to their mobile devices. We understand the challenge of finding housing and want to provide help using the tech development we have today.</p>

 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: Our solution aims to address the pressing issue of housing insecurity, recognizing its profound impact on both physical and mental health outcomes. Housing insecurity refers to the lack of stable and affordable housing, which can lead to a range of negative health consequences for individuals and communities. We do know how interlinked are housing issues and health outcomes, housing is one of the main factors of social determinants of health which has a strong influence on health. 
Physical Health Impacts: Housing insecurity can exacerbate existing health conditions and contribute to the development of new health problems. Individuals living in unstable housing situations may face overcrowding, exposure to environmental toxins, and inadequate access to healthcare services. These conditions increase the risk of respiratory illnesses, infectious diseases, and chronic health conditions such as asthma and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the stress and uncertainty associated with housing instability can weaken the immune system and exacerbate mental health conditions, further compromising overall health.Mental Health Impacts: Housing insecurity is closely linked to poor mental health outcomes, including increased stress, anxiety, and depression. The uncertainty of not knowing where one will sleep at night or whether they will be able to afford rent can take a significant toll on individuals' mental well-being. Chronic stressors associated with housing insecurity can contribute to mood disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, children growing up in unstable housing environments may experience developmental delays, academic struggles, and long-term emotional trauma, impacting their mental health and future prospects.
Social Determinants of Health: Social determinants of health, such as housing, education, employment, and access to healthcare, play a critical role in shaping individuals' health outcomes and overall quality of life. Stable and affordable housing provides a sense of security and stability that is essential for individuals to prioritize their health and well-being.
In summary, housing insecurity has far-reaching implications for both physical and mental health outcomes, highlighting the importance of addressing social determinants of health factors to ensure the well-being of individuals and communities. By providing access to affordable housing options and supportive resources, our solution aims to mitigate the negative health impacts of housing insecurity and promote health equity for all members of society. Through collaboration with community partners and ongoing evaluation, we seek to create lasting improvements in health outcomes and foster thriving, resilient communities.

We want to ultimately facilitate connections between users, housing advocates, and community organizations to provide support, resources, and assistance throughout the search and application process.
To measure our progress towards these impact goals, we utilize a combination of quantitative and qualitative indicators:
Info on secured housing: We request users to update us through quick clicks if they ended up securing a housing successfully through our platform. This indicator provides insight into the tangible impact of our solution on addressing housing insecurity. We do understand that not everyone would let us know if they did secure housing, but we will try to get that as much as possible by providing an easier and user-friendly platform. User Engagement Metrics: We analyze user engagement metrics such as website traffic, page views, and session duration to assess the level of user interest and interaction with our platform.

 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: The core technology that powers our solution revolves around the use of web technologies, mobile communication, and data management systems. Our solution aims to leverage modern technology to address the pressing issue of providing affordable housing options and related resources to those in need, while also ensuring scalability and accessibility to all. Here are how we use the elements:
Website Development: Our primary platform is a website that serves as a central hub for accessing housing information &amp; resources, along with educational videos. We utilize web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The website allows users to browse through various housing options, access educational videos, and download necessary forms and applications to not just understand the options, but also go through the process at ease.
SMS Alerts: To enhance accessibility and reach users who may not have access to the internet, we implement SMS technology to provide alerts and notifications. Users can register with us and opt to receive alerts via SMS, ensuring they stay informed about available housing options, updates, and relevant resources. This technology enables us to reach a wider audience and provide essential information directly to their mobile devices. We understand the challenge of finding housing and want to provide help using the tech development we have today.
Database Management: In backend, we use database management systems such as MySQL to efficiently store and manage user data, housing listings, educational resources, and other information. This allows for seamless retrieval and organization of data, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need.
Future App Development: As our platform evolves and user needs evolve, we recognize the potential for developing a mobile application to complement our website. Through a thorough necessity analysis, we will assess the demand for a mobile app and determine its feasibility, prior moving forward to building an app.
By leveraging these technologies, our solution aims to empower individuals in need of affordable housing options by providing them with easily accessible resources, educational materials, and timely alerts. Through the seamless integration of web and mobile technologies, we strive to bridge the gap between housing seekers and available resources, ultimately working towards a more equitable and inclusive housing ecosystem.

91039,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Pharmeasy: Tanzania's first digital healthcare platform offering online consultations and medication delivery for all.,"Ilalangulu, Tanzania",Tanzania,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>In Tanzania, Pharmeasy tackles the critical issue of limited access to quality healthcare services and medications amidst significant healthcare challenges. Tanzania's healthcare system grapples with alarming rates of maternal and child mortality, prevalent diseases like HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and malaria, and a shortage of healthcare personnel. With over 60% of healthcare facilities government-run and the remainder divided between faith-based and private entities, accessibility remains a pressing concern for many Tanzanians.</p>
<p>Maternal mortality in Tanzania stands at approximately 556 deaths per 100,000 live births, while child mortality is notably high at 54 deaths per 1,000 live births. These figures represent substantial challenges to maternal and child health, with many deaths being preventable with timely access to quality healthcare services and medications.</p>
<p>Tanzania bears a significant burden of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and malaria, contributing to high mortality rates and straining the healthcare system. Approximately 4.7% of adults aged 15-49 in Tanzania are living with HIV/AIDS, highlighting the urgency of effective healthcare interventions and access to antiretroviral therapy.</p>
<p>Moreover, pneumonia and malaria are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Tanzania, particularly among children under five years old. It is estimated that pneumonia accounts for 13% of deaths among children under five, while malaria remains a significant public health threat, with Tanzania being among the countries with the highest malaria burden in the world.</p>
<p>One of the critical factors exacerbating these challenges is the severe shortage of healthcare personnel. Tanzania has one of the lowest rates of access to health personnel globally, with only 0.3 physicians and 2.8 nurses and midwives per 10,000 people. This shortage of healthcare professionals severely limits access to essential healthcare services, especially in rural and remote areas where the majority of the population resides.</p>
<p>Pharmeasy addresses these pressing healthcare challenges by providing a comprehensive digital healthcare platform that offers online consultations with qualified doctors and convenient delivery of genuine medications and essential healthcare products. By leveraging technology, Pharmeasy bridges the gap between patients and healthcare providers, particularly in underserved communities where access to traditional healthcare facilities is limited.</p>
<p>Through Pharmeasy, individuals in Tanzania can access timely medical advice and obtain necessary medications without the need to travel long distances or wait in crowded healthcare facilities. This not only improves access to healthcare services but also facilitates early detection and management of health issues, ultimately contributing to reduced maternal and child mortality rates and better management of prevalent diseases like HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and malaria.</p>
<p>Pharmeasy's innovative solution aligns with Tanzania's healthcare priorities and government efforts to strengthen the healthcare system through technology and innovation. By complementing existing healthcare services, Pharmeasy plays a vital role in building a more resilient and accessible healthcare system in Tanzania, ultimately improving health outcomes and well-being across the country.</p>","<p>Pharmeasy is Tanzania's pioneering digital healthcare platform, revolutionizing how people access medical services and medications.

91099,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,IoT powered Telemedicine solution that enhances access to primary care for underserved populations in Latin America,"Guatemala City, Guatemala",Guatemala,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>According to the World Health Organization, around 50% of the world's population does not have access to quality medical care. Latin America, with its culturally and ethnically diverse populations, high levels of violence, growing political instability, and staggering levels of inequality, is quite a difficult region to tackle. Due to this, Latin American health systems are fragmented and segmented, limiting the region's ability to provide equitable access to public health services and quality medical care and guarantee the right to health of its populations. In the Latin American region alone, it is estimated that there are more than 165 million people without access to health services and the vast majority live in rural areas with high rates of poverty.</p>
<p>Although all employed Guatemalan citizens and their families are entitled to social security, the actual coverage provided by the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS) in 2016 was only around 20%. Additionally, while the Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for offering free services to the remainder of the Guatemalan population, the combined effective coverage of IGSS and MOH only reached around 50% of the total population. Private insurance penetration remains low, at less than 10%.</p>
<p>The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recently reported that over 50% of medical expenses in Guatemala are paid out of pocket. This indicates that approximately 9 million Guatemalans must seek alternative healthcare solutions in the private sector, often at a significant distance from their place of residence and at a high cost. This situation is particularly challenging for individuals residing in rural areas, where healthcare resources are even scarcer, with a ratio of only 1.2 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants compared to 4.2 doctors per 10,000 in more affluent urban areas.</p>
<p>Some of the consequences of this situation are reflected in the elevated rates of chronic malnutrition (49.8%), infant mortality (23.3/1000 live births), and maternal mortality (88 per 100,000 live births). In addition, Guatemala is undergoing a rapid epidemiological transition where chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension are becoming more prevalent, especially among underserved communities. </p>
<p>Considering the above, innovative solutions are needed to counter this situation and improve the well-being of the population, particularly among those historically underserved. Bitmec Health Technologies is a Guatemala-based startup that strives to improve access to healthcare services in Guatemala and abroad by developing and introducing scalable and affordable technological solutions within underserved populations.</p>","<p>Bitmec has developed an IoT telemedicine booth that facilitates access to high-quality primary care in underserved areas. The booth provides an enclosed, secure, and private space within a compact footprint of 14 square feet. This design allows for installation in virtually any indoor or outdoor setting, including community pharmacies, plazas, community centers, microfinance organization branches, and more. </p>
<p>The booth can be wirelessly operated either by a POS terminal, which unlocks it at the point of care, or by utilizing a self-service kiosk embedded in the outer panel of the booth. Before granting access, the booth undergoes a disinfection process and conducts a self-diagnostic sequence to verify the optimal functioning of all its systems.</p>
<p>Once inside, patients engage with a primary care physician via a high-resolution camera, a screen, speakers, and medical-grade sensors embedded throughout the booth. These sensors gather heart rate, oxygen saturation, height, weight, blood pressure, and body temperature. In addition, the boot includes a digital stethoscope that picks up heart and lung sounds. On the other end of the screen, remote primary care professionals guide patients through the entire process in real-time, record the measurements captured by sensors, and document the interaction using a proprietary telemedicine platform equipped with an embedded EMR module.</p>
<p>Upon concluding the consultation, prescriptions, lab orders, and referrals can be printed if necessary or sent electronically. Additionally, follow-up visits can be scheduled as needed.</p>
<p>The booth can access the internet via an embedded SIM card or a direct Ethernet port. This technology only requires access to a standard 110v power outlet and is equipped with a voltage regulator and a battery pack to withstand power surges and adapt to unreliable grid connectivity.</p>
<p>Leveraging its IoT capabilities, the booth is remotely monitored from Bitmec's headquarters. Through its network operations center, Bitmec can continuously track a range of parameters, such as internet speed, consumable levels, and sensor health, in real time. This monitoring process is aimed at maximizing booth uptime and ensuring seamless operation.</p>
<p>The integration of hardware and software in Bitmec's telemedicine booth ensures that patients can conveniently and reliably receive comprehensive remote care, offering an experience closely resembling an in-person visit. This versatility makes the booth applicable to a wide range of settings, particularly benefiting underserved populations.</p>","<p>Our solution serves a wide range of individuals, including:</p>
<p>Underserved Populations: Those residing in rural or remote areas with limited access to healthcare facilities can benefit greatly from our telemedicine booths. By bringing virtual consultations directly to their communities, we bridge the gap in access to medical services and provide timely healthcare assistance where it is needed the most.</p>
<p>Urban Dwellers: This is especially beneficial for individuals who work long hours for modest wages, as they may find it challenging to take time off for traditional medical appointments. Patients can receive quality medical care without the need to commute or wait for extended times, enhancing accessibility and efficiency.</p>
<p>Patients with Mobility Issues: For individuals with mobility challenges or disabilities, accessing traditional healthcare facilities can be particularly burdensome. Our solution eliminates the need for physical travel, allowing these patients to receive necessary medical attention in nearby community spaces, such as pharmacies, community centers, and convenience stores.</p>
<p>The impact of our solution on the lives of the target population includes:</p>
<p>Increased Access to Care: By bringing healthcare directly to communities, we ensure that individuals who previously faced barriers to access can now receive timely medical assistance.</p>
<p>Enhanced Productivity: Our telemedicine booths offer convenient access to medical consultations, reducing the time employees or self-employed individuals need to spend away from work for healthcare appointments. <br /></p>
<p>Improved Health Outcomes: Early detection and treatment of medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes can lead to better health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs in the long run.</p>
<p>Cost Savings: By reducing the need for physical travel and eliminating unnecessary emergency room visits, our telemedicine booths can help patients reduce the financial burden of an illness.</p>","<p>Bitmec boasts a multidisciplinary team with a wealth of expertise spanning engineering, public health, economics, product design, and venture capital management.

Reduced Inequalities",Growth,"<p>Our process began with a deep dive into the healthcare landscape of Guatemala. We engaged with healthcare professionals, community leaders, and government officials to gain insights into the prevailing challenges and unmet needs in urban and rural settings. Through interviews and surveys, we gathered qualitative and quantitative data to understand our target audience's preferences, pain points, and expectations.<br /></p>
<p>As we refined our product concept, we initiated pilot tests in five communities across Guatemala. These on-the-ground experiences allowed us to observe firsthand how patients and healthcare providers interacted with our telemedicine booth, providing invaluable feedback on usability, functionality, and overall user experience.</p>
<p>Through these pilots, we also identified key features and functionalities that resonated most strongly with users, such as vital signs measurements, privacy during the medical encounter, and data safety. This also allowed us to fine-tune our solution to address the specific needs and preferences of the end user. Throughout this process, we prioritized affordability, accessibility, and reliability to ensure that our telemedicine booth could effectively serve underserved populations across Guatemala and other countries in the region.</p>
<p>In addition, the field experience allowed us to validate the demand for our telemedicine solution and assess the willingness to pay. Finally, these experiences also enabled us to develop and validate our business model. </p>
<p>We've delivered services to over 20 communities, serving more than 5000 patients in Guatemala, and have already established a presence in several countries across the region. Our goal for the upcoming year is to extend our reach even further. We consider this program to be a vital catalyst in propelling our expansion objectives forward.</p>","<p>We are applying to Solve because we believe in the power of collaboration to overcome challenges and drive meaningful change. One of the significant hurdles facing Bitmec is navigating the complex regulatory landscape as we aim to expand our telemedicine solution to more regulated markets such as Mexico and Colombia, as well as other regions globally.</p>
<p>To scale our solution effectively, we need to attain international certifications, starting with the ISO13485-2016 certification for medical devices. Subsequently, we will pursue a CE mark and FDA clearance, which are essential for market entry in many countries worldwide. However, obtaining these certifications entails significant costs and may result in delays that impede our company's growth trajectory.</p>
<p>If selected to participate in the Solve program, we hope to receive support in navigating the regulatory landscape. Specifically, we seek assistance in mapping out regulatory requirements across different countries, connecting us with regulatory experts who can provide guidance and advice, and potentially securing funding, whether through grants, loans, or investment, to cover the expenses associated with obtaining certifications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while not directly related to regulatory affairs, we are also interested in receiving advice from intellectual property (IP) experts. We aim to explore opportunities for patenting components of our telemedicine solution, understand the timeline and costs involved, and identify funding sources to cover these expenses, whether through grants or investment.</p>
<p>Another area where Solve can help Bitmec is in exploring ways to reduce the cost of our telemedicine booths. By identifying opportunities for cost optimization and efficiency improvements in the manufacturing process, sourcing of materials, or technology components, we can significantly lower the production costs of our booths. This, in turn, would enable us to scale our solution more rapidly as less capital would be required for expansion. Reducing the cost of the booths would directly benefit end-users by making access to healthcare even more affordable and convenient. Lower costs would make our telemedicine services accessible to a broader segment of the population, particularly those in underserved communities who may face financial barriers to healthcare. By leveraging Solve's network of experts and partners in manufacturing, supply chain management, and technology, we can identify innovative solutions to drive down costs while maintaining the quality and effectiveness of our telemedicine booths.</p>
<p>Overall, we believe that the resources and connections offered through Solve can help us overcome these barriers and accelerate the growth and impact of our telemedicine solution, ultimately enabling us to reach more underserved communities and improve access to healthcare globally.</p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Legal or Regulatory Matters, Product / Service Distribution (e.g. delivery, logistics, expanding client base), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)",Alvaro Rivera  - Co-founder & Chief Product Officer ,No,No,,"Yes, this solution is already (or has been in the past) a part of other networks","<p>Startup Chile (2019)</p>

 Provide a one-line summary of your solution.: IoT powered Telemedicine solution that enhances access to primary care for underserved populations in Latin America
 In what city, town, or region is your solution team headquartered?: Guatemala City, Guatemala
 In what country is your solution team headquartered?: Guatemala
 What type of organization is your solution team?: For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: nan
 What specific problem are you solving?: According to the World Health Organization, around 50% of the world's population does not have access to quality medical care. Latin America, with its culturally and ethnically diverse populations, high levels of violence, growing political instability, and staggering levels of inequality, is quite a difficult region to tackle. Due to this, Latin American health systems are fragmented and segmented, limiting the region's ability to provide equitable access to public health services and quality medical care and guarantee the right to health of its populations. In the Latin American region alone, it is estimated that there are more than 165 million people without access to health services and the vast majority live in rural areas with high rates of poverty.
Although all employed Guatemalan citizens and their families are entitled to social security, the actual coverage provided by the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS) in 2016 was only around 20%. Additionally, while the Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for offering free services to the remainder of the Guatemalan population, the combined effective coverage of IGSS and MOH only reached around 50% of the total population. Private insurance penetration remains low, at less than 10%.
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recently reported that over 50% of medical expenses in Guatemala are paid out of pocket. This indicates that approximately 9 million Guatemalans must seek alternative healthcare solutions in the private sector, often at a significant distance from their place of residence and at a high cost. This situation is particularly challenging for individuals residing in rural areas, where healthcare resources are even scarcer, with a ratio of only 1.2 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants compared to 4.2 doctors per 10,000 in more affluent urban areas.
Some of the consequences of this situation are reflected in the elevated rates of chronic malnutrition (49.8%), infant mortality (23.3/1000 live births), and maternal mortality (88 per 100,000 live births). In addition, Guatemala is undergoing a rapid epidemiological transition where chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension are becoming more prevalent, especially among underserved communities. 
Considering the above, innovative solutions are needed to counter this situation and improve the well-being of the population, particularly among those historically underserved. Bitmec Health Technologies is a Guatemala-based startup that strives to improve access to healthcare services in Guatemala and abroad by developing and introducing scalable and affordable technological solutions within underserved populations.
 What is your solution?: Bitmec has developed an IoT telemedicine booth that facilitates access to high-quality primary care in underserved areas. The booth provides an enclosed, secure, and private space within a compact footprint of 14 square feet. This design allows for installation in virtually any indoor or outdoor setting, including community pharmacies, plazas, community centers, microfinance organization branches, and more. 
The booth can be wirelessly operated either by a POS terminal, which unlocks it at the point of care, or by utilizing a self-service kiosk embedded in the outer panel of the booth. Before granting access, the booth undergoes a disinfection process and conducts a self-diagnostic sequence to verify the optimal functioning of all its systems.
Once inside, patients engage with a primary care physician via a high-resolution camera, a screen, speakers, and medical-grade sensors embedded throughout the booth. These sensors gather heart rate, oxygen saturation, height, weight, blood pressure, and body temperature. In addition, the boot includes a digital stethoscope that picks up heart and lung sounds. On the other end of the screen, remote primary care professionals guide patients through the entire process in real-time, record the measurements captured by sensors, and document the interaction using a proprietary telemedicine platform equipped with an embedded EMR module.
Upon concluding the consultation, prescriptions, lab orders, and referrals can be printed if necessary or sent electronically. Additionally, follow-up visits can be scheduled as needed.
The booth can access the internet via an embedded SIM card or a direct Ethernet port. This technology only requires access to a standard 110v power outlet and is equipped with a voltage regulator and a battery pack to withstand power surges and adapt to unreliable grid connectivity.
Leveraging its IoT capabilities, the booth is remotely monitored from Bitmec's headquarters. Through its network operations center, Bitmec can continuously track a range of parameters, such as internet speed, consumable levels, and sensor health, in real time. This monitoring process is aimed at maximizing booth uptime and ensuring seamless operation.
The integration of hardware and software in Bitmec's telemedicine booth ensures that patients can conveniently and reliably receive comprehensive remote care, offering an experience closely resembling an in-person visit. This versatility makes the booth applicable to a wide range of settings, particularly benefiting underserved populations.

The engaging content and testimonials from the Solver community highlighted the transformative impact of the program, prompting us to explore how Solve could accelerate our own impact on maternal health.
 What makes your solution innovative?: The CareConnect app is innovative in three main ways. Firstly, it utilizes AI to analyze individual health data, enabling us to deliver tailored advice and monitoring based on the unique health profiles and needs of each user. This is a significant shift from the one-size-fits-all approach that is common in the current health services available in the region. Secondly, by leveraging technology, CareConnect ensures that essential health guidance and monitoring tools are accessible to women in remote areas who may not have regular access to medical facilities. This drastically reduces the time it takes to detect and respond to potential health issues. Lastly, our platform includes tools specifically designed for CHWs, providing them with up-to-date health information and relevant time data about the mothers they are assisting. This empowers community health workers and enhances their ability to offer effective support, potentially transforming the community health landscape.
By introducing these innovations, Maternanet aims to catalyze broader positive impacts, encouraging other health tech initiatives to adopt similar digital health solutions. Our approach could set a new standard for integrating technology in maternal healthcare, ultimately leading to a market where advanced, personalized care is the norm, not an exception. This could significantly amplify the reach and effectiveness of maternal health interventions globally, contributing to a substantial decrease in maternal mortality rates in underserved regions.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: Maternanet's digital platform offers educational content, real-time health monitoring, and communication tools for pregnant women and new mothers in underserved areas. We train local health workers on how to use the platform and offer ongoing support and updates based on user feedback and technological advancements.
Expected outputs include increased access to timely and relevant health information by both pregnant women and new mothers via the app, improved and continuous health monitoring that allows for early detection of potential complications, and improved communication between healthcare providers and mothers, resulting in faster response in emergencies.
We anticipate outcomes such as increased maternal health knowledge, awareness, and understanding of maternal health issues among the target demographic, which will lead to better self-care. Second, by detecting and intervening in health issues early on, pregnancy-related health risks are reduced. We also anticipate strengthened healthcare networks, as health workers become more effective and empowered, resulting in stronger healthcare support networks in communities.
As a direct result of better education, monitoring, and personalized care, we expect a significant reduction in maternal mortality rates in the communities we serve, as well as healthier outcomes for both mothers and babies.
According to WHO research, women's health behaviors improve significantly when they have access to maternal health education. Studies published in the Journal of Mobile Technology in Medicine show that mobile health interventions can lead to early detection of complications, significantly lowering morbidity and mortality. Additionally, data from pilot programs show that improved communication channels between health workers and the mothers they serve can reduce emergency response times by up to 50%.

Maternanet's logical framework is founded on evidence-based practices that use technology to close gaps in healthcare access and education. We hope to promote long-term improvement in maternal health outcomes in underserved communities by directly connecting activities to their logical outputs and desired outcomes. Maternanet is dedicated to adapting and improving its impact over time, ensuring that CareConnect remains a critical tool in the fight against maternal mortality.

 What are your impact goals for your solution and how are you measuring your progress towards them?: Maternanet has three major impact goals that guide its overall strategy and development plan. The first goal is to reduce maternal mortality by 30% and improve maternal health outcomes in targeted regions within five years. The second goal is to ensure that 90% of pregnant women and new mothers in our program areas have access to and use our digital health platform for information and services by year 3. Finally, over the next three years, at least 500 healthcare providers will be trained and empowered to use digital tools to improve maternal health services in their communities.
We will use a variety of metrics to effectively track progress toward our impact goals. The first is an annual reduction in maternal mortality rates in intervention areas, which is measured using health department records and feedback from biannual community health surveys. To assess the level of access to information and services, we will look at the percentage of the targeted population that has registered and is active on the CareConnect platform, as tracked by platform data analytics that provide insights into user registration, activity levels and engagement metrics. As an indicator of increased healthcare capacity, we will look for the number of healthcare providers who have been trained to use the CareConnect platform and have implemented it in their daily practice, as evidenced by training completion records and post-training performance assessments that demonstrate effective use of digital tools in healthcare delivery.
The UN Sustainable Development Goal on Good Health and Well-Being, which aims to reduce global maternal mortality rates to less than 70 per 100,000 live births, is closely aligned with Maternanet's implementation of innovative solutions to reduce maternal mortality through improved access to healthcare information and services.

Regionally, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounted for 47.2% of those deaths. This indicates that a child born in SSA is 15 times more likely to die than a child born in Europe or North America. Sadly, most of these deaths are a result of avoidable causes. Approximately 75% of newborn deaths could be prevented if these patients were able to access timely medical care from trained health workers.<br /></p>
<p>Amidst the challenges of neonatal mortality in SSA, Kenya has seen a gradual decline in its neonatal mortality rate over the past 30 years, moving from 27 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1991 to 18 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021. This is partly due to the rise of facility-based deliveries and the effectiveness of antenatal care services.Despite the positive trend, health facilities in Kenya frequently grapple with a lack of sufficient resources to provide essential neonatal care , coupled with human resource challenges<br />that continue to put high acuity newborns at significant risk of deterioration and subsequent mortality. </p>
<p>A critical gap in these facilities is the limited availability of continuous vitals data to support effective resource allocation and healthcare delivery.

Measurement of vital signs is an important component of many best practice neonatal care procedures, such as those outlined in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Recommendations on Newborn Health , and in the Kenya Ministry of Health, Clinical management and Referral Guidelines. Increasing coverage of optimal supportive care, including effective monitoring of vital signs in Newborn Care Units (NBCU) can help prevent an estimated 41-72% of neonatal deaths worldwide. 
The lack of a platform to visualize data trends prevents health facilities from gaining valuable insights into their patient population which affects resource allocation and healthcare delivery.
 What is your solution?: Neopenda’s neoCloud is a cloud-based platform that enables aggregation and visualization of data collected from Neopenda’s neoGuard vital signs monitor devices. NeoCloud will enable hospitals as well as other healthcare andgovernment entities to gain valuable insight into its patient populations, including the number of patients served, their conditions, outcomes, and demographic information. The ability to draw trends in this data will better equip healthcare entities to allocate resources, provide care, and cater to the specific needs of their patients. We have found that developing countries have lagged in EMR adoption due to organizational, financial and infrastructural factors – Neopenda’s ability to overcome these issues and streamline processes will be paramount.
The image below shows the proposed dashboard for neoCloud.



 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : Our solution serves health facilities in low and middle income countries. 
Neopenda's neoGuard has been designed to fulfill the unmet need of vital sign monitoring in critically ill newborns aged 0-28days in LMICs. The 0-28 day age group is the primary focus of this technology owing to their vulnerability and high risk for severe morbidity and mortality. Nurses and clinicians caring for newborns also benefit from receiving access to adequate and sustainable equipment that enhance their efficiency and enable them to deliver the most appropriate care to their patients 
Neopenda's neoCloud provides the additional benefit to health facilities by ensuring that resources are procured and allocated in a timely manner to patients who need it most. Also, ensuring that nurses and clinicians are more efficient in their delivery of care.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: As a medical device company, Neopenda's key area of expertise is creating needs-based health technology for high-growth emerging markets. The organization is led by co-founders Sona Shah(CEO) and Teresa Cauvel (CTO) - two mission-driven, globally oriented engineers who met in graduate school at Columbia University, where they developed the initial idea of Neopenda in a biomedical design course. 
Neopenda is a global organization with 60% of full time staff located in Sub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana). Collectively, we have relevant expertise in a number of areas including product design and development, biomedical engineering, project management, regulatory and quality systems, supply chain, business strategy, customer support, biostatistics, clinical research, and monitoring and evaluation. 
In addition to hiring local talent for out internal team, we also continue to engage and work with a number of external stakeholders, including government partners, non-profit and multilateral institutions, local distributors and academic researchers to better understand the nuances of the health systems we seek to serve. Over the last 7 years, we have firmly established networks and connections with health facilities and research organizations in Kenya, Zambia and Nigeria. We regularly conduct feasibility and user experience studies to ensure that our technology is in line with the needs of the communities we work in.

 What makes your solution innovative?: NeoCloud’s competitive advantage stems from its ability to provide value to several different customer bases. The natural application of neoCloud is to enable hospital administrators with aggregated insights that answer questionsthey would previously be unable to resolve, but the information that neoCloud collects has proven relevant to NGOs, pharmaceutical companies, and beyond. Further, the opportunity to partner with Africa-focused EMR systems creates another niche for neoCloud to add value without the need to redefine existing processes.Other value propositions for neoCloud are outlined below:The first being that it is responsive to the needs of existing neoGuard customers. neoCloud’s differentiation stems from its natural build upon the neoGuard device and serves as a proactive response to the questions Neopenda’s existing customers are seeking to answer about their patients.Secondly, it has a broader application beyond hospitals. NeoCloud lays the foundation for broader insights across hospitals, regions and beyond that would be invaluable to NGOs, government organizations, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies. Thirdly, neoCloud is highly customizable by application. neoCloud's dashboards are dynamic and designed to be regularly used to draw insights across different time periods, patient subsets, etc. NeoCloud is affordable. Enterprise-wide solutions can be extremely costly and typically upfront. On the other hand, neoCloud’s pricing allows resource-constrained environments to save money thanks to automation of tasks, early prevention, and a historical view of patients’ health.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: Our theory of change is as follows:1. Input: NeoGuard and neoCloud are adopted by health facilities and health staff are trained to use it 2. Direct Output: Critically ill newborns are monitored with the neoGuard technology; vital sign data is measured and recorded in the neoCloud software 3. Short Term Outcome: Health facilities administrators generate valuable insights on the health outcomes of patients 4. Intermediate Outcome: Health facilities administrators optimize health care delivery and resource allocation to the different wards. 5. Long term outcome: Improved newborn mortality, improved health care delivery 
 What are your impact goals for your solution and how are you measuring your progress towards them?: Our impact goals are:a. Increase access to an affordable vital signs monitoring solution and digitalized data archive in at least 50 health facilities across 5 countries. b. Complete training of over 200 health staff to use the neoGuard technology and increase health staff satisfaction with regard to availability of effective tools to perform their tasks and aid in clinical decision making. This will be achieved through broadening our customer outreach efforts and performing bi-annual feedback surveys for new and existing users of the neoGuard and neoCloud. Responding promptly to customer feedback or complaints will be key, and we have already put in place a robust customer complaint handling process. c. Support provision of clinical care to over 1500 patients observed with the neoGuard vital signs monitor.
 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: NeoGuard is a 4-in-1 biometric monitoring device designed specifically for newborns in resource-constrained health facilities. The affordable system helps over-burned healthcare workers better manage their patients and improves speed of action for newborns in distress so that they have the best chance to receive the care they need to survive and thrive. Ulimately, it contributes to reducing preventable newborn mortality and morbidity. The patented neoGuard vital signs monitor uses reflectance pulse oximetry and temperature sensors to continuously measure 4 key vital signs: pulse rate(PR), respiration rate (RR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), and tempertature. The neoGuard technology is manufactured, packaged and shipped from CPI Penang, a contract manufacturer in Malaysia. Data from the neoGuard device is inputted into the neoCloud software, which is a cloud based software.

 Provide a one-line summary of your solution.: GoPillz is a personal digital care assistant using generative AI to help resource constrained communities with better health. 
 In what city, town, or region is your solution team headquartered?: New Delhi, Delhi, India
 In what country is your solution team headquartered?: India
 What type of organization is your solution team?: For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: nan
 What specific problem are you solving?: At GoPillz, we are solving the access, awareness and inclusivity problem in healthcare and the resultant poor health outcomes.
70% of our population is urban poor or rural poor. Chronic diseases disproportionately affect vulnerable and marginalized populations, including low-income individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, migrant populations and rural communities. Disparities in access to healthcare, socioeconomic determinants of health, and environmental factors contribute to disparities in healthcare experiences and outcomes.
Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory conditions, are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality with
56.5% of the total disease burden in India attributable to NCDs.28% of older adults  in India, have multiple diseases.
63% of all deaths in India are due to chronic diseases.
Chronic diseases impose a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems, governments, and households due to the high costs of treatment, hospitalizations, medications, and long-term care accounting for 86% of preventable spend and 50% emergency spend.
Every two in three seniors today suffers from a chronic ailment. Every one in six Indians suffers from a chronic ailment. 
Early onset of chronic conditions in LMICs affects both the working and the elderly population. For instance, an estimated 15 million people die annually due to NCDs in the working age group of 30 to 69 years, among whom 85% are from LMICs. While evidence from a few developed countries shows that morbidity is being compressed into a shorter period, many developing countries are undergoing morbidity expansion.
With almost one-fifth of the world’s population, India is also undergoing a major health and epidemiological shift. 200 m people migrate every year due to socio- economic factors. Globalization and urbanization are taking its toll and  hence the importance of comprehensive NCD management for the  educated and non-educated, urban and rural, rich and poor, as they all struggle with chronic diseases, multiple co-morbidities.
 What is your solution?: We are building SLM’s to help solve various use cases in healthcare. Our current focus area is chronic care management. Our first application is GoPillz, a personal digital care assistant to help users with their healthcare and caregiving needs. GoPillz interacts with users using two way near human-like conversations over Whatsapp and Voice. We help patients with better awareness, guidance on their health conditions, improved adherence to prescribed treatment, subsequently better treatment management with improved health outcomes. We have gamified our prediction models to help users with personalised risk assessment, and coaching with ease. Communication over Whatsapp, sms and Voice help users with varying input abilities.  With a not so literate population in LMIC's  alternative input &amp; interaction methods over voice, sms, &amp; WhatsApp helps with better self management and  empowered patients fostering better care with improved health outcomes. Using the coordinated care model, we bridge the gap as an always-available care companion when patients are most vulnerable and need guidance and handholding. We help patients navigate their care journeys with ease while reducing stress, easing up the caregivers burden and solving pain points for caregivers, support systems, and ecosystem partners alike.
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : We are working to improve the health of urban poor, rural poor and migrant communities. In India every year, 200 m million people migrate on account of urbanisation, socio-economic factors, and climate change. 70% of our population is either urban poor and rural poor. Chronic ailments disproportionately impact these populations due to various factors, low literacy levels, socio-economic determinants of health.We are working towards creating awareness of health conditions, better hygiene practices, personalised risk assessment, coaching, health education, lifestyle management, improving adherence to medication, better treatment management with improved health outcomes. 
Using coordinated care, we sync the support systems, families, caregivers and care providers to help users with better health. 
To help users along the care continuum we help with access to health and life insurance and low cost care financing options.
India also has a diverse population with different languages. Using NLU and NLG we provide access to users with low literacy levels, varying abilities with access to care over Whatsapp, voice and sms as communication mediums. 
As we use AI, SLM's to improve access, we also reduce burden on health systems, increase efficiency, reduce turnaround time and solve pain points for other stakeholders such as doctors, hospitals, pharma, payers such as health and life insurance,  and the government.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: We are running GoPillz for the long haul till we impact a billion lives and have a brilliant exit. We are a core team of three with founders like business advisors, involved with core development of the product since inception.

It takes the form of a glove that connects to various displays, including computer screens, phones, and even basic LCD screens. Made with breathable cotton and equipped with lightweight touch sensors on the fingers, the Swarna glove allows users to communicate through clicks. The Swarna glove shines with its adaptability. Users can pick their preferred interface (Qwerty keyboard default) and customize it further through a linked app. It supports multiple languages and goes beyond single clicks (24 total) with swipes and plans for even more gestures like double clicks..
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : Current Challenge: People with speech disabilities face communication barriers. They may rely on limited options like assistive technology, sign language, or basic communication aids that restrict expression. These limitations hinder their ability to engage in everyday conversations, express themselves freely and creatively, access information and education, and participate actively in work. Swarna's Impact: The glove utilizes intuitive clicks and swipes on familiar screens, eliminating the need for complex software or hardware. Users can choose their preferred communication method (including multiple languages in the future) and personalize it further through the companion app. The glove goes beyond single clicks, offering swipes and planned features like double clicks, allowing for richer and more nuanced communication. 
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: The Swarna project is completely focused on understanding the needs of users. To bridge the gap between people with speech disabilities and everyday communication, we prioritize collaboration with the very community we aim to serve. Through partnerships with non-profit organizations, and user testing sessions, the Swarna project ensures the glove addresses real-world challenges. This close collaboration promotes the development of a solution desired by the community, ultimately promoting wider adoption and standing for those with speech disabilities.

92076,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,A Game of Resilience teaches toxically stressed individuals to recognize the cause and reduce or eliminate it.,"Anchorage, AK, USA",United States,Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit,,"<p>Throughout the world, large populations suffering from Toxic Stress experience increased behavioral and health issues that reduce quality of life and life span. Among American Indian/Alaska Native adult populations in the United States, levels of Toxic Stress are more than double the level of the general population. Using the Adverse Childhood Experience Study (ACES) as a major root cause of Toxic Stress targets 10 parent behaviors (ACEs) as a major source of toxic stress. Adults who experienced 6 of 10 ACEs during childhood have average life span reduced by 19.5 years. Men in their mid 20's with 6 plus ACEs experience a 4,600% increase in IV Drug use over an adult with none. Children who are experiencing ACEs as they grow have lower levels of academic achievement, higher rates of dropping out, more behavioral issues and are sent to Juvenile Justice detention centers more frequently. Rates of depression, suicide, alcohol/drug abuse, domestic violence, sexual abuse, crime and numerous negative outcomes emerge from ACEs exposure through a graded, dose responsive relationship--the more ACEs experienced lead to higher outcomes of health and behavior issues.</p>
<p>Addressing Toxic Stress with ACEs as a significant root cause provides an answer to an ages old question, ""What's wrong with me?"" Adults with Toxic Stress have multiple negative outcomes in many aspects of their life. Yet treatment for this major root cause is delivered in siloes and not addressed systemically.</p>
<p>Science also demonstrates that many of the negative outcomes to Toxic Stress are related to nutritional deficiencies. With many ACEs victims living with limited incomes or with poverty, access to nutritious foods is hindered. </p>","<p>Resetting levels of Toxic Stress is the goal of what I have been calling Restoring our Health. It is based on a very simple concept-reducing the frequency of our brain releasing cortisol in response to layered levels of fear. In addition to a systemic approach laid out in writing, we envision a digital video game that can help inform younger people about the impact of cortisol on their body.</p>
<p>A Game of Resilience: Filling the Gap, is in its prototype a board game that visually presents a simple Fear Feedback Loop though a Role Playing Game. The concept is to create a digital game that can be distributed widely to a younger population of adults. Characters will be able to differentiate as Normal, Tolerable and Toxically Stressed based on discovery of childhood acquired trauma (ACEs). In the course of the game, building a graded, dose responsive list of ACEs leads to increased outcomes on a scale not yet identified. Cumulating the outcomes divides a player into Normal, Tolerable and Toxic levels, impairing performance. Acquiring ACEs becomes a visible way of looking at Toxic Stress and how easy it occurs during childhood.</p>
<p>The Gap represents the difference between the stress balance achieved by Normal and Toxic. Being in Balance stops the flow of cortisol for Normal Stress. Toxic Stress has cortisol flows that may continue for days if not months. In the game, a range of behaviors, described as Negative, Positive and Neutral, provide a release of chemicals or hormones that alleviate stress temporarily. Consisting of Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Endorphins (DOSE), a player can function by filling their gap with Positive, Neutral and Negative behaviors that release a DOSE and alleviate Toxic Stress for a period of time. </p>
<p>Digital games command a lot of time from a young adult demographic. If designed well, this game will inform a player who may have Toxic Stress what it consists of, and provide both an exciting experience while practicing the identification of a cortisol release, intercepting it with practices that stop the release and promote healing the Gap.</p>
<p>Dr. Vincent Feliitti, the brilliant co-Principal Investigator of the Adverse Childhood Experience Study, stated very eloquently that the goal of a physician should not be to ask what's wrong with a patient, but to ask what happened to the patient. The Game of Resilience on a board was designed to help an individual understand that their behaviors and health outcomes are significantly dependent on what happened to them as children, and to a lesser extent as adults. Digital games can build the complexity of multiple trauma and toxic stress feedback loops into a game with healing artifacts that educate as well as entertain.</p>
<p>A video game can be very expensive to build, but if A Game Of Resilience is successful and reduces the cost impact of poor health and behavioral issues, the cost is justified.</p>","<p>The initial target population is a young American Indian/Alaska Native demographic with a high rate of Toxic Stress, defined as exposure to four or move of the ten parent behaviors examined in the ACES. According to the ACE Study, this demographic has higher rates of poverty, incarceration and mental disorders. Their behaviors have a range that can be viewed as Positive, Neutral or Negative that are driven by the Fear Response and the temporary relief provided by a release of a DOSE chemical. But the entire world population has similar experiences. For white, Western European resident of the US, there are fewer categorized as Toxically Stressed, but the game can help that demographic achieve the same healing result. ACE Studied populations worldwide have varying degrees of Toxic Stress, but the mechanisms for healing the Gap are the same, stop the release of cortisol if no physical threat is present.</p>
<p>In Alaska, there are few mental health resources available. And the behavioral health system has not been using innovative nor creative methods of addressing mental, behavioral and health issues. Nutritional interventions have reduced binge drinking (Omega 3 EFA supplementation), suicidal behavior (Omega 3 Supplementation and Niacin) and depression (Omega 3 and Niacin). The game concept envisions the use of support tokens that provide a nutritional supplement to enhance performance and strengthen a character to meet some of the challenges in the game. But rather than providing for Vampires to drink blood, a character takes a supplement that it earns by a positive behavior.</p>
<p>In a Role Playing Game that focuses on character degradation through Toxic Stress and rehabilitation through positive practices, analytics can be built in to assess whether there is any real life improvement from Toxically Stressed players. If the game is successful in supporting healing the gap caused by Toxic Stress, then word of mouth and social media discussion can speed the discussion and bring more participants. Associated books, programs, videos and training can reach a broader population based on interest. </p>
<p>Over a life span, Toxic Stress imposes substantial economic cost on society and individuals. From addressing education deficiencies to suicide attempt and completion, these costs aggregate over a life span and can be reduced if resolved early in life, at a time when video games are  played extensively.</p>","<p>This systems approach to addressing Toxic Stress is unique and innovative. The ACE Study was published in 1998 and is still being discovered by individuals who are in the Early Adopters phase of the Rogers Innovation Curve. The healing method of addressing cortisol reduction and nutritional supports is not common among behavioral health practitioners. As a newly envisioned systems approach, this team has the only access to this systems approach to healing. </p>
<p>Patrick Anderson is connected to the National Congress of American Indians and has extensive knowledge about ACES, its impact and the theories behind Toxic Stress. He has presented this information to various audiences at NCAI and has interest from potential places to implement a clinical approach he outlined five years ago. Indian Tribes have suffered from a variety of community based issues where Toxic Stress is a negative driver of results. AI/AN Tribes have been described as a ""canary in the coal mine"" revealing problems earlier than the rest of society. AI/AN Tribes are also served by a nationally funded health care system that addresses these issues, although using only traditional clinical services. Most of those services have not been effective.</p>
<p>This effort is also guided by a psychiatrist who is informed by newer healing practices similar to those represented in the Game of Resilience, and a team of innovators and creators who are working on the intersection of climate change and health in many parts of the world.</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","1. No Poverty, 2. Zero Hunger, 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 4. Quality Education, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 16. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions",Concept,"<p>In the Rogers Innovation Curve, Dr. Rogers differentiates between Innovators and Creators and Early Adopters. Patrick Anderson's business manage process, learned in health and behavioral health care settings, fits into the Innovator and Creator category with some early adopters beginning to understand the problems and attempting various solutions, mostly using existing proposed solutions. The board game developed was a prototype that engaged a number of visitors to a booth at the National Congress of American Indians, but its primary purpose was to solicit input about its potential use. It was well received. </p>
<p>The Restoration to Health program, with its two goals of preventing imposition of CAT on children and healing CAT in Adults was originally designed as a written program with coaches helping clients learn about their dosage of Toxic Stress and engage in practices, such as breathing, trauma release, nutrition and identifying/recusing their fear response cortisol dump, to reduce of eliminate the dump. Less cortisol should result in less stress.</p>
<p>Individual parts of the entire healing system have been extensively studied, but not used as a system. The closest use is a program developed by Dr. Joseph Gordon with his concept of Soft Belly Breathing and Shaking and Dancing, two step along the feedback look for restoring balance. Gary Craig has effectively used Emotional Freedom Technique to reduce or eliminate PTSD from U.S. Veterans who had diagnoses in place for from 5 to 30 years by 50 to 100% reduction of symptoms. </p>
<p>By envisioning a video game, where Role Playing can be used for a character to acquire Toxic Stress, meet challenges and apply practices to recharge their character and strengthen it through regular picking up Tokens of healing practices seems like a way of educating a population where many might heal. If success is achieved and share, the information will be shared with many others.</p>
<p>Health and behavior issues are protected information in the U.S. because people don't want to reveal some secrets, especially those that have penalties. Discussing being a victim of depression can affect a person in many negative ways. A video game that can be played confidentially can help if it reveals a players Toxic Stress and demonstrates methods of healing them/</p>","<p>I do not have an advanced degree in health or behavior, and have approached what I refer to as a Restoration to Health approach from the perspective of a lay victim. After widely sharing the construct of a systems approach to healing, I discovered that there is heavy resistance to changing the way we work. As I build out my network, I have looked to an International partner, Planet Health, to look for places to pilot the program. I have early exploratory  interest from the Kingdom of Tonga and 2 American Indian tribes and one Alaska Native Village. Establishing a research path that unifies the siloes of treatment that exist is a second goal, and I have joined an effort to develop a healing and spirituality center at Yale University with a graduate currently practicing as a psychiatrist. I have another established relationship with another former NIH research psychiatrist who has effective used nutrition in his practice. </p>
<p>My immediate need is to consolidate the program into writing and begin implementation in a test site with assessments by professionals and scientific studies. MIT was an early research institute looking at the early assessment of the management system I use, studied as the Toyota Production System or Lean Thinking. Jay Forrester's early research on systems, followed by Womack, Jones and Roos resulting in the book the Machine that Changed the World, inspired my early thinking. Stephen Spears book, Chasing the Rabbit, told me that innovation and creativity are not reserved for geniuses, and that well educated systems thinkers can change the world.</p>
<p> </p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)",Patrick M. Anderson ,Yes,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Email from your network,"<p>I received an email from a federal government employee, Shaun Deschane from the U.S. Department of Commerce, forwarding a message from Jael Whitney at MIT announcing the Indigenous Communities Fellowship, sent of April 18, 2023. Shaun viewed the prototype Game of Resilience in its board form and was impressed with the Restoration to Health Strategy it represented. As I write a book about the game of resilience, I have advanced to concept to a state where I believe it is ready to pilot. </p>","<p>After managing health, clinical, behavioral and substance use services, I became aware of how difficult healing was and began to look for a more focused solution. After extensive study of the Adverse Childhood Experience Study and its findings of a link between parental behaviors and negative health/behavioral outcomes, I found research linking the fear response to a requirement for movement, fight or flight. The third response, freeze, did not involve movement. Research linked a release of cortisol in the body to preparation for movement and healing. Adrenaline, epinephrine and norepinephrine, plus other body actions, prepared the body to react of a physical threat. When the threat was addressed by movement, the human body quickly returned to balance in preparation for the next threat.</p>
<p>If movement didn't occur, the cortisol response was not used and the body likely interpreted lack of movement as a call for more cortisol. In an individual with a high fear response developed during childhood, the body stayed in a state of preparation for movement, with higher blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol levels and inflammation in preparation for healing woulds. Without movement or wounds to heal, the body started to cause certain feelings that needed a response, often described as fear or anxiety.</p>
<p>The human body feels emotion and a cortisol escalation seems to require distraction and other chemical stimulation for temporary relief. That stimulation is likely provided by activation of response that activates the DOSE chemicals, Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Endorphins, each capable of providing pleasurable relief. But the relief doesn't last, but because the brain feels the relief, requires more, leading to an addictive response. This led to the idea of a gap in the fear feedback look requiring DOSE chemical release. This response was expanded from negative outcomes to positive and neutral behaviors that elicited praise or positive reaction from peers. Multiple responses to fear saw a ""Start"" of responses adopted by people. The behaviors used to elicit responses in the stack can be categorized as positive, neutral or negative behaviors based on how they are perceived. </p>
<p>Athletes, singers, comedians and other performers receive praise for their involvement and extra praise for excellence. Seeking more opportunities for a positive reaction to behaviors releases DOSE Chemicals. Temporary Relief follows.</p>
<p>The Restoration to Health Program recognizes that the gap is not reduced by DOSE responses, only temporarily alleviated. Reducing the size of the gap requires understanding why and when cortisol is released and preventing the release. A variety of practice can reduce or stop a cortisol release, or follow it with movement to top the cortisol response.With practice, the gap can be decreased in size, requiring fewer responses in the stack, and might be capable of eventual elimination of the gap.</p>","<p>The Restoration to Health Program addresses practices that end a fear response: breathing, trauma release movement, reversing nutritional deficits and energy practices to start reducing the fear response.</p>
<p>Early research on emotion states that emotion has no language. Instead, the way we describe what is happening to us is through development of a constructed language describing emotion. Lisa Feldman Barratt's theory is being expanded in a way that explains how different cultures develop an emotional language to describe what we feel. That is what we talk about in current behavioral services. Yet what we feel is linked to a lack of movement after a fear response. The loop is not balanced so our feelings become trauma which is carried in the body. This is likely what Bessel Van der Kolk discusses in his book, The Body Keeps The Score. </p>
<p>Reduction of cortisol in the body as the likely solution to trauma has promising results in the work of Gary Craig, the Founder of Emotional freedom Technique, or EFT. Research about EFT found it reduces the cortisol response by 40 to 60 percent, and has healed U.S. Veterans suffering from PTSD. Meditation, Mindfulness, EMDR, Ericksonian Hypnosis, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and practices such as Yoga have a role in reducing cortisol releases. Trauma Release Exercise as a means of inducing tremoring, helps remove cortisol because of the movement caused. James Gordon's soft belly breathing and shaking and dancing inspire the same response and release endorphins. </p>
<p>Many individuals also suffer from nutritional deficiencies that feed behavioral and mental disorders. Bill W., a cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous, was advised to take 3 grams of niacin daily and within 14 days reported that eh finally found relief from the depression that fueled his drinking. Dr. Abram Hoffer was able to relieve schizophrenia with large doses of B Vitamins. Alexander Schaluss was able to withdraw opioid addicts in five days without symptoms by using 26 grams of Vitamin C daily for 2 days before withdrawal and 5 days following. Dr. Joesph Hubbell found that Omega 3 EFA's reduced suicides completions among U.S. Veterans, provided a 1/3rd reduction in serious violence in juvenile and adult correctional facilities as well as reduced binge drinking by 880%.</p>
<p>Change will require considerable practice and support. ApplyingRobin Dunbar's trust paradox requires establishing the Game of Resilience: Filling the Gap, as a trusted cultural and traditional practice with appropriate results and symbolism, similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Healing together in small groups of 6 to 10, which is bounding the intimate trust circle discussed by Dunbar, should create a healing support group. </p>
<p>But the most critical aspect of healing is inspiring adherence to a system, which comes with confidence in the results. With a psychiatrist, a planned university based healing and spiritualism research program and a nonprofit focused on underserved areas of the world, the results should become apparent quickly.</p>","<p>Childhood Acquired Trauma has a plethora of negative effects that burden humans by early adulthood. Education is slowed before school starts and dropping out is higher among toxically stressed students. Many social indicators of health are caused by CAT, including behaviors that affect employability, health issues, risky behaviors and poor relationship choices. Incarceration, disciplinary actions and other societal impacts prevent many adults from achieving a happy and successful life. </p>
<p>Preventing CAT is the best solution and presents the best outcomes. But for the toxically stressed, understanding how that happened and adhering to proven practices for reducing or eliminating toxic stress is a secondary solution. It will be necessary to support healing with programs for backfilling the education, emotional and cultural deficiencies acquired because of CAT.</p>
<p>The Game of Resilience is intended to work on reducing a stack when the client is ready. If a stack is supporting a client, we don't know the impact of removing a supporting behavior if it is still necessary. When a stack support isn't available for some time, the client may swap for another behavior temporarily, either improving frequency of an existing stack behavior or adopting a new one for a time. When a behavior is no longer available, the client may switch to another behavior. This might mean progressing to more damaging behaviors in the stack. </p>
<p>Current programs are aimed at single behaviors and services delivered in siloes. Smoking cessation is one such program, but research doesn't examine whenever quitting smoking is followed by an increase in or addition to the stack. Perhaps the new behavior is increased domestic violence and causes more damage than continuing the behavior. By addressing multiple siloed behavioral treatments in one program, escalation or adoption of behaviors can be monitored and extinguished more readily.</p>
<p>One measure is to measure the cortisol in the blood regularly for increases or decreases. Monitoring stress and associating higher levels with certain behaviors and body feelings help alert the client to use cortisol reduction techniques. </p>
<p>The actual video game that is the subject of this application should be designed to educate a potential client in a zone of safety where risks can occur without real damage, and behaviors intentionally changed as actions in the game.</p>
<p>For example, a young adult might find out through the game that they 8 parent 8 parent behaviors causing a very toxic level of stress. as they pursue goals of the game, their disabilities hinder performance. But by picking up a package of Breathing, Trauma Release Exercise, Niacin, Omega 3's, a medication pack or mindfulness pack, they gain a small measure of temporary relief. As use of packs accumulate, the body starts to heal and perform longer without the packs until it is healed. At that time, the supplement packs can change into enhancement packs and advancements though the game becomes easier.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>The fear response is the foundation that determines good or poor health. Research by Joseph LeDoux, Ph.D. at New York University helped promote understanding of the brain in new ways. Robert Sapolsky explains the fear response and how it works in Zebras through his book, Why Zebra's Don't Get Ulcers. He expands our understanding through his book, ""Behave, The Biology of Humans At Our Best and Worst. This foundation of knowledge inspires a theory of response to fear by reducing it in toxically stressed adults with a clear message. Cortisol is a friend for normal stress, and an enemy for toxic stress. Let's reduce it.</p>
<p>Many of the interventions mentioned above are science based, but suppressed because of competitive and political blockers. The video game is capable of being spread using the internet and can be augmented by virtual reality to categorize CAT symptoms, its impact on performance and application of healing technologies to exchange performed. </p>",A new business model or process that relies on technology to be successful,,"Ancestral Technology & Practices, Behavioral Technology, Crowd Sourced Service / Social Networks, Software and Mobile Applications, Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality",,,"Australia,Tonga","<p>In the concept stage, we have only volunteers.

 In what country is your solution team headquartered?: United States
 What type of organization is your solution team?: Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: nan
 What specific problem are you solving?: Throughout the world, large populations suffering from Toxic Stress experience increased behavioral and health issues that reduce quality of life and life span. Among American Indian/Alaska Native adult populations in the United States, levels of Toxic Stress are more than double the level of the general population. Using the Adverse Childhood Experience Study (ACES) as a major root cause of Toxic Stress targets 10 parent behaviors (ACEs) as a major source of toxic stress. Adults who experienced 6 of 10 ACEs during childhood have average life span reduced by 19.5 years. Men in their mid 20's with 6 plus ACEs experience a 4,600% increase in IV Drug use over an adult with none. Children who are experiencing ACEs as they grow have lower levels of academic achievement, higher rates of dropping out, more behavioral issues and are sent to Juvenile Justice detention centers more frequently. Rates of depression, suicide, alcohol/drug abuse, domestic violence, sexual abuse, crime and numerous negative outcomes emerge from ACEs exposure through a graded, dose responsive relationship--the more ACEs experienced lead to higher outcomes of health and behavior issues.
Addressing Toxic Stress with ACEs as a significant root cause provides an answer to an ages old question, ""What's wrong with me?"" Adults with Toxic Stress have multiple negative outcomes in many aspects of their life. Yet treatment for this major root cause is delivered in siloes and not addressed systemically.
Science also demonstrates that many of the negative outcomes to Toxic Stress are related to nutritional deficiencies. With many ACEs victims living with limited incomes or with poverty, access to nutritious foods is hindered. 
 What is your solution?: Resetting levels of Toxic Stress is the goal of what I have been calling Restoring our Health. It is based on a very simple concept-reducing the frequency of our brain releasing cortisol in response to layered levels of fear. In addition to a systemic approach laid out in writing, we envision a digital video game that can help inform younger people about the impact of cortisol on their body.
A Game of Resilience: Filling the Gap, is in its prototype a board game that visually presents a simple Fear Feedback Loop though a Role Playing Game. The concept is to create a digital game that can be distributed widely to a younger population of adults. Characters will be able to differentiate as Normal, Tolerable and Toxically Stressed based on discovery of childhood acquired trauma (ACEs). In the course of the game, building a graded, dose responsive list of ACEs leads to increased outcomes on a scale not yet identified. Cumulating the outcomes divides a player into Normal, Tolerable and Toxic levels, impairing performance. Acquiring ACEs becomes a visible way of looking at Toxic Stress and how easy it occurs during childhood.
The Gap represents the difference between the stress balance achieved by Normal and Toxic. Being in Balance stops the flow of cortisol for Normal Stress. Toxic Stress has cortisol flows that may continue for days if not months. In the game, a range of behaviors, described as Negative, Positive and Neutral, provide a release of chemicals or hormones that alleviate stress temporarily. Consisting of Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Endorphins (DOSE), a player can function by filling their gap with Positive, Neutral and Negative behaviors that release a DOSE and alleviate Toxic Stress for a period of time. 
Digital games command a lot of time from a young adult demographic. If designed well, this game will inform a player who may have Toxic Stress what it consists of, and provide both an exciting experience while practicing the identification of a cortisol release, intercepting it with practices that stop the release and promote healing the Gap.
Dr. Vincent Feliitti, the brilliant co-Principal Investigator of the Adverse Childhood Experience Study, stated very eloquently that the goal of a physician should not be to ask what's wrong with a patient, but to ask what happened to the patient. The Game of Resilience on a board was designed to help an individual understand that their behaviors and health outcomes are significantly dependent on what happened to them as children, and to a lesser extent as adults. Digital games can build the complexity of multiple trauma and toxic stress feedback loops into a game with healing artifacts that educate as well as entertain.
A video game can be very expensive to build, but if A Game Of Resilience is successful and reduces the cost impact of poor health and behavioral issues, the cost is justified.
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : The initial target population is a young American Indian/Alaska Native demographic with a high rate of Toxic Stress, defined as exposure to four or move of the ten parent behaviors examined in the ACES. According to the ACE Study, this demographic has higher rates of poverty, incarceration and mental disorders. Their behaviors have a range that can be viewed as Positive, Neutral or Negative that are driven by the Fear Response and the temporary relief provided by a release of a DOSE chemical. But the entire world population has similar experiences. For white, Western European resident of the US, there are fewer categorized as Toxically Stressed, but the game can help that demographic achieve the same healing result. ACE Studied populations worldwide have varying degrees of Toxic Stress, but the mechanisms for healing the Gap are the same, stop the release of cortisol if no physical threat is present.
In Alaska, there are few mental health resources available. And the behavioral health system has not been using innovative nor creative methods of addressing mental, behavioral and health issues. Nutritional interventions have reduced binge drinking (Omega 3 EFA supplementation), suicidal behavior (Omega 3 Supplementation and Niacin) and depression (Omega 3 and Niacin). The game concept envisions the use of support tokens that provide a nutritional supplement to enhance performance and strengthen a character to meet some of the challenges in the game. But rather than providing for Vampires to drink blood, a character takes a supplement that it earns by a positive behavior.
In a Role Playing Game that focuses on character degradation through Toxic Stress and rehabilitation through positive practices, analytics can be built in to assess whether there is any real life improvement from Toxically Stressed players. If the game is successful in supporting healing the gap caused by Toxic Stress, then word of mouth and social media discussion can speed the discussion and bring more participants. Associated books, programs, videos and training can reach a broader population based on interest. 
Over a life span, Toxic Stress imposes substantial economic cost on society and individuals. From addressing education deficiencies to suicide attempt and completion, these costs aggregate over a life span and can be reduced if resolved early in life, at a time when video games are  played extensively.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: This systems approach to addressing Toxic Stress is unique and innovative. The ACE Study was published in 1998 and is still being discovered by individuals who are in the Early Adopters phase of the Rogers Innovation Curve. The healing method of addressing cortisol reduction and nutritional supports is not common among behavioral health practitioners. As a newly envisioned systems approach, this team has the only access to this systems approach to healing. 
Patrick Anderson is connected to the National Congress of American Indians and has extensive knowledge about ACES, its impact and the theories behind Toxic Stress. He has presented this information to various audiences at NCAI and has interest from potential places to implement a clinical approach he outlined five years ago. Indian Tribes have suffered from a variety of community based issues where Toxic Stress is a negative driver of results. AI/AN Tribes have been described as a ""canary in the coal mine"" revealing problems earlier than the rest of society. AI/AN Tribes are also served by a nationally funded health care system that addresses these issues, although using only traditional clinical services. Most of those services have not been effective.
This effort is also guided by a psychiatrist who is informed by newer healing practices similar to those represented in the Game of Resilience, and a team of innovators and creators who are working on the intersection of climate change and health in many parts of the world.
 Which dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address?: Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).
 Which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals does your solution address?: 1. No Poverty, 2. Zero Hunger, 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 4. Quality Education, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 16. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions
 What is your solution’s stage of development?: Concept
 Please share details about why you selected the stage above.: In the Rogers Innovation Curve, Dr. Rogers differentiates between Innovators and Creators and Early Adopters. Patrick Anderson's business manage process, learned in health and behavioral health care settings, fits into the Innovator and Creator category with some early adopters beginning to understand the problems and attempting various solutions, mostly using existing proposed solutions. The board game developed was a prototype that engaged a number of visitors to a booth at the National Congress of American Indians, but its primary purpose was to solicit input about its potential use. It was well received. 
The Restoration to Health program, with its two goals of preventing imposition of CAT on children and healing CAT in Adults was originally designed as a written program with coaches helping clients learn about their dosage of Toxic Stress and engage in practices, such as breathing, trauma release, nutrition and identifying/recusing their fear response cortisol dump, to reduce of eliminate the dump. Less cortisol should result in less stress.
Individual parts of the entire healing system have been extensively studied, but not used as a system. The closest use is a program developed by Dr. Joseph Gordon with his concept of Soft Belly Breathing and Shaking and Dancing, two step along the feedback look for restoring balance. Gary Craig has effectively used Emotional Freedom Technique to reduce or eliminate PTSD from U.S. Veterans who had diagnoses in place for from 5 to 30 years by 50 to 100% reduction of symptoms. 
By envisioning a video game, where Role Playing can be used for a character to acquire Toxic Stress, meet challenges and apply practices to recharge their character and strengthen it through regular picking up Tokens of healing practices seems like a way of educating a population where many might heal. If success is achieved and share, the information will be shared with many others.
Health and behavior issues are protected information in the U.S. because people don't want to reveal some secrets, especially those that have penalties. Discussing being a victim of depression can affect a person in many negative ways. A video game that can be played confidentially can help if it reveals a players Toxic Stress and demonstrates methods of healing them/
 Why are you applying to Solve?: I do not have an advanced degree in health or behavior, and have approached what I refer to as a Restoration to Health approach from the perspective of a lay victim. After widely sharing the construct of a systems approach to healing, I discovered that there is heavy resistance to changing the way we work. As I build out my network, I have looked to an International partner, Planet Health, to look for places to pilot the program. I have early exploratory  interest from the Kingdom of Tonga and 2 American Indian tribes and one Alaska Native Village. Establishing a research path that unifies the siloes of treatment that exist is a second goal, and I have joined an effort to develop a healing and spirituality center at Yale University with a graduate currently practicing as a psychiatrist. I have another established relationship with another former NIH research psychiatrist who has effective used nutrition in his practice. 
My immediate need is to consolidate the program into writing and begin implementation in a test site with assessments by professionals and scientific studies. MIT was an early research institute looking at the early assessment of the management system I use, studied as the Toyota Production System or Lean Thinking. Jay Forrester's early research on systems, followed by Womack, Jones and Roos resulting in the book the Machine that Changed the World, inspired my early thinking. Stephen Spears book, Chasing the Rabbit, told me that innovation and creativity are not reserved for geniuses, and that well educated systems thinkers can change the world.

 Who is the Team Lead for your solution?: Patrick M. Anderson 
 Is the Team Lead a resident of the United States?: Yes
 Have you or someone else from your organization ever been selected as a Solver for an MIT Solve Global Challenge or for the Indigenous Communities Fellowship?: No
 Explain what makes your solution different from when you or your organization was previously selected.: nan
 Is your solution an active or past participant in another entrepreneurship network? : No, Solve is the first network joined
 Please share the names of the other entrepreneurship networks.: nan
 Did you take the MITx course “Business and Impact Planning for Social Enterprises?” : No, I didn’t take the course
 How did you first hear about Solve?: Email from your network
 Tell us more about how you found out about Solve’s 2024 Global Challenges.: I received an email from a federal government employee, Shaun Deschane from the U.S. Department of Commerce, forwarding a message from Jael Whitney at MIT announcing the Indigenous Communities Fellowship, sent of April 18, 2023. Shaun viewed the prototype Game of Resilience in its board form and was impressed with the Restoration to Health Strategy it represented. As I write a book about the game of resilience, I have advanced to concept to a state where I believe it is ready to pilot. 
 What makes your solution innovative?: After managing health, clinical, behavioral and substance use services, I became aware of how difficult healing was and began to look for a more focused solution. After extensive study of the Adverse Childhood Experience Study and its findings of a link between parental behaviors and negative health/behavioral outcomes, I found research linking the fear response to a requirement for movement, fight or flight. The third response, freeze, did not involve movement. Research linked a release of cortisol in the body to preparation for movement and healing. Adrenaline, epinephrine and norepinephrine, plus other body actions, prepared the body to react of a physical threat. When the threat was addressed by movement, the human body quickly returned to balance in preparation for the next threat.
If movement didn't occur, the cortisol response was not used and the body likely interpreted lack of movement as a call for more cortisol. In an individual with a high fear response developed during childhood, the body stayed in a state of preparation for movement, with higher blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol levels and inflammation in preparation for healing woulds. Without movement or wounds to heal, the body started to cause certain feelings that needed a response, often described as fear or anxiety.
The human body feels emotion and a cortisol escalation seems to require distraction and other chemical stimulation for temporary relief. That stimulation is likely provided by activation of response that activates the DOSE chemicals, Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Endorphins, each capable of providing pleasurable relief. But the relief doesn't last, but because the brain feels the relief, requires more, leading to an addictive response. This led to the idea of a gap in the fear feedback look requiring DOSE chemical release. This response was expanded from negative outcomes to positive and neutral behaviors that elicited praise or positive reaction from peers. Multiple responses to fear saw a ""Start"" of responses adopted by people. The behaviors used to elicit responses in the stack can be categorized as positive, neutral or negative behaviors based on how they are perceived. 
Athletes, singers, comedians and other performers receive praise for their involvement and extra praise for excellence. Seeking more opportunities for a positive reaction to behaviors releases DOSE Chemicals. Temporary Relief follows.
The Restoration to Health Program recognizes that the gap is not reduced by DOSE responses, only temporarily alleviated. Reducing the size of the gap requires understanding why and when cortisol is released and preventing the release. A variety of practice can reduce or stop a cortisol release, or follow it with movement to top the cortisol response.With practice, the gap can be decreased in size, requiring fewer responses in the stack, and might be capable of eventual elimination of the gap.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: The Restoration to Health Program addresses practices that end a fear response: breathing, trauma release movement, reversing nutritional deficits and energy practices to start reducing the fear response.
Early research on emotion states that emotion has no language. Instead, the way we describe what is happening to us is through development of a constructed language describing emotion. Lisa Feldman Barratt's theory is being expanded in a way that explains how different cultures develop an emotional language to describe what we feel. That is what we talk about in current behavioral services. Yet what we feel is linked to a lack of movement after a fear response. The loop is not balanced so our feelings become trauma which is carried in the body. This is likely what Bessel Van der Kolk discusses in his book, The Body Keeps The Score. 
Reduction of cortisol in the body as the likely solution to trauma has promising results in the work of Gary Craig, the Founder of Emotional freedom Technique, or EFT. Research about EFT found it reduces the cortisol response by 40 to 60 percent, and has healed U.S. Veterans suffering from PTSD. Meditation, Mindfulness, EMDR, Ericksonian Hypnosis, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and practices such as Yoga have a role in reducing cortisol releases. Trauma Release Exercise as a means of inducing tremoring, helps remove cortisol because of the movement caused. James Gordon's soft belly breathing and shaking and dancing inspire the same response and release endorphins. 
Many individuals also suffer from nutritional deficiencies that feed behavioral and mental disorders. Bill W., a cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous, was advised to take 3 grams of niacin daily and within 14 days reported that eh finally found relief from the depression that fueled his drinking. Dr. Abram Hoffer was able to relieve schizophrenia with large doses of B Vitamins. Alexander Schaluss was able to withdraw opioid addicts in five days without symptoms by using 26 grams of Vitamin C daily for 2 days before withdrawal and 5 days following. Dr. Joesph Hubbell found that Omega 3 EFA's reduced suicides completions among U.S. Veterans, provided a 1/3rd reduction in serious violence in juvenile and adult correctional facilities as well as reduced binge drinking by 880%.
Change will require considerable practice and support. ApplyingRobin Dunbar's trust paradox requires establishing the Game of Resilience: Filling the Gap, as a trusted cultural and traditional practice with appropriate results and symbolism, similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Healing together in small groups of 6 to 10, which is bounding the intimate trust circle discussed by Dunbar, should create a healing support group. 
But the most critical aspect of healing is inspiring adherence to a system, which comes with confidence in the results. With a psychiatrist, a planned university based healing and spiritualism research program and a nonprofit focused on underserved areas of the world, the results should become apparent quickly.
 What are your impact goals for your solution and how are you measuring your progress towards them?: Childhood Acquired Trauma has a plethora of negative effects that burden humans by early adulthood. Education is slowed before school starts and dropping out is higher among toxically stressed students. Many social indicators of health are caused by CAT, including behaviors that affect employability, health issues, risky behaviors and poor relationship choices. Incarceration, disciplinary actions and other societal impacts prevent many adults from achieving a happy and successful life. 
Preventing CAT is the best solution and presents the best outcomes. But for the toxically stressed, understanding how that happened and adhering to proven practices for reducing or eliminating toxic stress is a secondary solution. It will be necessary to support healing with programs for backfilling the education, emotional and cultural deficiencies acquired because of CAT.
The Game of Resilience is intended to work on reducing a stack when the client is ready. If a stack is supporting a client, we don't know the impact of removing a supporting behavior if it is still necessary. When a stack support isn't available for some time, the client may swap for another behavior temporarily, either improving frequency of an existing stack behavior or adopting a new one for a time. When a behavior is no longer available, the client may switch to another behavior. This might mean progressing to more damaging behaviors in the stack. 
Current programs are aimed at single behaviors and services delivered in siloes. Smoking cessation is one such program, but research doesn't examine whenever quitting smoking is followed by an increase in or addition to the stack. Perhaps the new behavior is increased domestic violence and causes more damage than continuing the behavior. By addressing multiple siloed behavioral treatments in one program, escalation or adoption of behaviors can be monitored and extinguished more readily.
One measure is to measure the cortisol in the blood regularly for increases or decreases. Monitoring stress and associating higher levels with certain behaviors and body feelings help alert the client to use cortisol reduction techniques. 
The actual video game that is the subject of this application should be designed to educate a potential client in a zone of safety where risks can occur without real damage, and behaviors intentionally changed as actions in the game.
For example, a young adult might find out through the game that they 8 parent 8 parent behaviors causing a very toxic level of stress. as they pursue goals of the game, their disabilities hinder performance. But by picking up a package of Breathing, Trauma Release Exercise, Niacin, Omega 3's, a medication pack or mindfulness pack, they gain a small measure of temporary relief. As use of packs accumulate, the body starts to heal and perform longer without the packs until it is healed. At that time, the supplement packs can change into enhancement packs and advancements though the game becomes easier.

 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: The fear response is the foundation that determines good or poor health. Research by Joseph LeDoux, Ph.D. at New York University helped promote understanding of the brain in new ways. Robert Sapolsky explains the fear response and how it works in Zebras through his book, Why Zebra's Don't Get Ulcers. He expands our understanding through his book, ""Behave, The Biology of Humans At Our Best and Worst. This foundation of knowledge inspires a theory of response to fear by reducing it in toxically stressed adults with a clear message. Cortisol is a friend for normal stress, and an enemy for toxic stress. Let's reduce it.
Many of the interventions mentioned above are science based, but suppressed because of competitive and political blockers. The video game is capable of being spread using the internet and can be augmented by virtual reality to categorize CAT symptoms, its impact on performance and application of healing technologies to exchange performed.

92119,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,myWellaBee: hyper-personalized food as medicine marketplace guided by nutrition experts and powered by AI,"Auckland, New Zealand",New Zealand,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>Food allergy and anaphylaxis are an increasing public health and economic burden. Food allergies affect about 7% of the US population and the prevalence is increasing, with a disproportionate impact on urban and African American communities. In 2021, an estimated 7.6% of Black children had a food allergy, compared with 5.3% of white children. In 2023, within the SAPPHIRE trial cohort, African American participants were significantly more likely to report food allergy (26.1% vs 17%) and have food-associated anaphylactic symptoms (12.7% vs 7%) when compared with European American participants. Environmental factors can also increase risk for fatal anaphylaxis from food allergies, and a disproportionate number of minorities live in urban settings with increased allergen exposures. Further, the hygiene hypothesis postulates that processed and unhealthy foods contribute to the development of food allergy due to the disruption of the gut microbiome. African Americans and marginalized groups are also more likely to live in areas where there is less access to affordable healthy food options. Additionally, families of those diagnosed with food allergy will often struggle to find safe, affordable food for their loved ones.

Currently, there is no optimal technology that exists to assist patients suffering from food allergies and intolerances in the community with buying safe food products. Once patients leave the clinic diagnosed with a food allergy, they often struggle to find appropriate, nutritious food and children often become picky, spare eaters. For these patients and their families, shopping is often a minefield - causing added stress and undue economic burden to their already busy lives.

 What specific problem are you solving?: Food allergy and anaphylaxis are an increasing public health and economic burden. Food allergies affect about 7% of the US population and the prevalence is increasing, with a disproportionate impact on urban and African American communities. In 2021, an estimated 7.6% of Black children had a food allergy, compared with 5.3% of white children. In 2023, within the SAPPHIRE trial cohort, African American participants were significantly more likely to report food allergy (26.1% vs 17%) and have food-associated anaphylactic symptoms (12.7% vs 7%) when compared with European American participants. Environmental factors can also increase risk for fatal anaphylaxis from food allergies, and a disproportionate number of minorities live in urban settings with increased allergen exposures. Further, the hygiene hypothesis postulates that processed and unhealthy foods contribute to the development of food allergy due to the disruption of the gut microbiome. African Americans and marginalized groups are also more likely to live in areas where there is less access to affordable healthy food options. Additionally, families of those diagnosed with food allergy will often struggle to find safe, affordable food for their loved ones. Being able to easily avoid food allergens is vital to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions and hospitalizations. 
To date, little is known about how best to support individuals and families to find safe foods to improve quality of life, reduce associated mental health issues, and prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. Currently, there is no optimal technology that exists to assist patients suffering from food allergies and intolerances in the community with buying safe food products. Once patients leave the clinic diagnosed with a food allergy, they often struggle to find appropriate, nutritious food and children often become picky, spare eaters. For these patients and their families, shopping is often a minefield - causing added stress and undue economic burden to their already busy lives. This project will further develop novel technology for improved management of food allergies with a focus on population sub-groups that are disproportionately impacted. 
 What is your solution?: This project will develop new technology powered by AI and Dietitians for improved management of food allergies and intolerances.
Our multidisciplinary team will develop a hyper-peronsalized food as medicine marketplace that builds upon an in-market Beta (mywellabee.com), applying artificial intelligence and knowledge graphs to enable individuals to accurately find safe foods.

The prevalence of this condition, known as strabismus, has surged, particularly among lower and upper primary school children, following the COVID-19 pandemic when the world went totally virtual for more than an year. For the excessive technology usage, disrupted lifestyle and sleep patterns during and after lockdowns kids showed significant changes in their eye health and some developed strabismus too.</p>
<p>Strabismus adversely affects individuals' ability to perform daily tasks, causing psychological and psychosocial challenges. The misalignment of the eyes and resulting appearance contribute to feelings of isolation, particularly among children, hampering their academic pursuits and life goals.</p>
<p>Strabismus, a prevalent eye condition among children, is commonly inherited, with approximately 30% of affected children having family members experiencing similar issues. It occurs when the eyes are improperly aligned, resulting in inward (esotropia), outward (exotropia), upward (hypertropia), or downward (hypotropia) deviation of one or both eyes.</p>
<p>Strabismus can be present at birth or acquired later in life due to factors such as accidents, trauma, or cerebral palsy. In some cases, it is intermittent, while in others, it is constant. Research indicates a rise in strabismus cases, particularly among children, following the pandemic due to increased screen usage.</p>
<p>Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent vision loss associated with amblyopia, commonly referred to as ""lazy eye."" Amblyopia occurs when proper vision development is hindered during childhood due to misaligned eyes.</p>
<p>Treatment options for strabismus include Vision Therapy, patching, eyeglasses, and, in rare instances, surgery. The most effective treatment involves supervised in-office Vision Therapy with additional home reinforcement. This therapy targets the root cause of the issue and boasts a success rate of 78%, surpassing that of surgery (48%). Surgery should only be considered as a last resort, specifically for cases of large-angle, intermittent exotropia, after unsuccessful attempts with Vision Therapy. It is important to note that surgery primarily provides cosmetic benefits.</p>","<p>Strabi-Cure consists of an eco-friendly jute string device, an innovation of brockstring and a beta eye recognition software that first identifies the occurrence of strabismus and then guides children through various exercises based on using the concepts of neuroplasticity to improve their vision.

TB remains a significant global public health challenge. In 2023, TB reclaimed its spot as the most deathly infectious globally, claiming nearly 1.6 million lives annually despite being a treatable disease. The burden of TB is particularly profound in South Africa, with an estimated 304,000 infections in 2021 and a staggering figure of 55,000 annual TB-related deaths in the country. The financial strain on healthcare systems is evident, with roughly US$210 Million allocated specifically for TB management in South Africa in 2022. The shortcomings of the current screening method exacerbate this burden, as it erroneously excludes 29% to 44% of TB-positive individuals from the outset and subjects 36% of TB-negative cases to unnecessary costly confirmation tests. To provide context, in 2021, only 172,194 cases were recorded for treatment out of an estimated 304,000 infections.</p>
<p>Globally, an estimated 10.6 million individuals fall ill from TB annually, with approximately 4.2 million TB patients missed each year. This disparity highlights the urgent need for improved TB screening methods to identify and treat cases early.  The lack of access to accurate and efficient TB screening exacerbates the diagnosis gap, resulting in increased mortality and economic costs. According to the UN, failure to address these issues is expected to result in an additional 43 million people developing TB and resulting in economic costs totalling US$1 trillion by 2023.</p>","<p>The solution is an Artificial Intelligence(AI)-enabled digital stethoscope designed to detect Tuberculosis (TB). It consists of three main parts: (i) The Stethoscope Hardware and supporting Firmware, (ii) The Application software and supporting Cloud Infrastructure, and (iii) a TB detection AI Model. The Stethoscope connects to the Application via Bluetooth. The Application guides the user through the chest auscultation procedure, indicating where the nurse/user should place the Stethoscope while guiding the patient's breath rate. The Stethoscope records the patient's lung sounds and background noise and sends the data to the Application. The Application transfers the data to the locally run AI container (for offline usage, a cloud-based version is also available). The AI container first checks the quality of the recorded data. If background noise exceeds a threshold, the user will be requested to repeat the recording. The lung audio recordings and clinical information (HIV status, etc.) are passed to the TB AI model. The AI Model then processes the data and outputs a TB prediction within seconds. The AI container returns the TB prediction to the Application, which is interpreted into an instruction displayed to the user. This instruction can be tailored to the use case and operating environment.</p>
<p><br />AI Diagnostics has developed the largest TB-validated auscultation database in the world (&gt;30,000 validated recordings), which serves as the training data for the AI Model. The training database was initially collected in a local clinical study that included 29 South African sites. The primary advantages of the solution lie in its enhanced detection accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 83% and 76%, respectively, as opposed to 71% and 64% for the current 4-symptom questionnaire. This translates to a significant reduction in missed TB cases (41%) and potentially lowers overall TB diagnosis costs by 33% through fewer unnecessary confirmation tests. The solution’s customizability offers flexibility in configuring decision thresholds based on specific environments or applications. The consumable-free nature of the tool eliminates the need for disposable components, addressing logistical challenges associated with storage, distribution, and safe disposal of consumables. Furthermore, the digitization of screening events in real-time provides valuable epidemiological insights, facilitating a more informed approach to TB diagnosis and management.</p>
<p><br />This solution is currently being reviewed by the World Health Organization TB advisors in an international study across 3 continents. Using the same technology, AI Diagnostics has plans to expand the detection capabilities into more pulmonary, cardiovascular, and abdominal diseases.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>The target population for the solution is individuals living in resource-limited communities with high burdens of tuberculosis (TB) around the world. These communities often face significant challenges in accessing timely and accurate TB diagnosis due to limitations in traditional diagnostic methods, such as the low sensitivity and specificity of the symptom-based questionnaire, the lack of infrastructure and trained personnel. Currently, vulnerable populations within these communities, including those with limited access to healthcare facilities or living in remote areas, are underserved in terms of TB diagnosis. They experience delays in diagnosis, leading to prolonged illness, increased transmission of TB within the community, and higher mortality rates.</p>
<p>Our AI-enabled Digital Stethoscope addresses these needs in several ways. Firstly, by eliminating the need for complex equipment, it makes TB screening more accessible, even in areas with limited infrastructure. This empowers healthcare workers, including those with less experience, to conduct reliable TB screenings, thus improving access to diagnosis for underserved populations. Early diagnosis reduces patient morbidity, it improves treatment outcomes and reduces period contagiousness, reducing the chance of spread amounts family members and peers.<br /><br /> The benefits of the solution extend beyond the individual. The digital stethoscope is designed to be cost-effective, reducing unnecessary expensive bacteriological confirmation tests. This translates to significant cost savings for resource-constrained healthcare systems. Additionally, the digitized screening data collected by the digital stethoscope provides invaluable insights into TB prevalence and patterns within these communities.  Armed with this information, healthcare officials can make data-driven decisions for TB control and resource allocation.  The AI stethoscope offers a promising solution to bridge the diagnostic gap and improve the lives of millions living under the shadow of TB. </p>","<p>Our team is based in South Africa, a country with an extremely high burden of TB.

 What specific problem are you solving?: The problem we aim to address is the inefficiency and inaccuracy of tuberculosis (TB) screening, which contributes to a substantial diagnosis gap and missed opportunities for early intervention. TB remains a significant global public health challenge. In 2023, TB reclaimed its spot as the most deathly infectious globally, claiming nearly 1.6 million lives annually despite being a treatable disease. The burden of TB is particularly profound in South Africa, with an estimated 304,000 infections in 2021 and a staggering figure of 55,000 annual TB-related deaths in the country. The financial strain on healthcare systems is evident, with roughly US$210 Million allocated specifically for TB management in South Africa in 2022. The shortcomings of the current screening method exacerbate this burden, as it erroneously excludes 29% to 44% of TB-positive individuals from the outset and subjects 36% of TB-negative cases to unnecessary costly confirmation tests. To provide context, in 2021, only 172,194 cases were recorded for treatment out of an estimated 304,000 infections.
Globally, an estimated 10.6 million individuals fall ill from TB annually, with approximately 4.2 million TB patients missed each year. This disparity highlights the urgent need for improved TB screening methods to identify and treat cases early.  The lack of access to accurate and efficient TB screening exacerbates the diagnosis gap, resulting in increased mortality and economic costs. According to the UN, failure to address these issues is expected to result in an additional 43 million people developing TB and resulting in economic costs totalling US$1 trillion by 2023.
 What is your solution?: The solution is an Artificial Intelligence(AI)-enabled digital stethoscope designed to detect Tuberculosis (TB). It consists of three main parts: (i) The Stethoscope Hardware and supporting Firmware, (ii) The Application software and supporting Cloud Infrastructure, and (iii) a TB detection AI Model. The Stethoscope connects to the Application via Bluetooth. The Application guides the user through the chest auscultation procedure, indicating where the nurse/user should place the Stethoscope while guiding the patient's breath rate. The Stethoscope records the patient's lung sounds and background noise and sends the data to the Application. The Application transfers the data to the locally run AI container (for offline usage, a cloud-based version is also available). The AI container first checks the quality of the recorded data. If background noise exceeds a threshold, the user will be requested to repeat the recording. The lung audio recordings and clinical information (HIV status, etc.) are passed to the TB AI model. The AI Model then processes the data and outputs a TB prediction within seconds. The AI container returns the TB prediction to the Application, which is interpreted into an instruction displayed to the user. This instruction can be tailored to the use case and operating environment.
AI Diagnostics has developed the largest TB-validated auscultation database in the world (&gt;30,000 validated recordings), which serves as the training data for the AI Model. The training database was initially collected in a local clinical study that included 29 South African sites. The primary advantages of the solution lie in its enhanced detection accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 83% and 76%, respectively, as opposed to 71% and 64% for the current 4-symptom questionnaire. This translates to a significant reduction in missed TB cases (41%) and potentially lowers overall TB diagnosis costs by 33% through fewer unnecessary confirmation tests. The solution’s customizability offers flexibility in configuring decision thresholds based on specific environments or applications. The consumable-free nature of the tool eliminates the need for disposable components, addressing logistical challenges associated with storage, distribution, and safe disposal of consumables. Furthermore, the digitization of screening events in real-time provides valuable epidemiological insights, facilitating a more informed approach to TB diagnosis and management.
This solution is currently being reviewed by the World Health Organization TB advisors in an international study across 3 continents. Using the same technology, AI Diagnostics has plans to expand the detection capabilities into more pulmonary, cardiovascular, and abdominal diseases.

92577,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,A locally manufactured high performance digital microscope and slide scanner for medical diagnostics.,"Glasgow, UK",United Kingdom,"Other, including part of a larger organization (please explain below)","<p>The OpenFlexure project began as an academic project. Some of the project core team members are employed at the University of Glasgow and University of Bath. Through research projects, OpenFlexure has been co-developed and tested by research institutions (Ifakara Heath Institute, Tanzania; Baylor College of Medicine, USA) and by a network of small manufacturers, primarily across sub-Saharan Africa. As the OpenFlexure project has matured, and more potential manufacturing partners are onboarded, it is clear that we need to establish a non-profit entity to govern the project. We hope that MIT solve will help us navigate this expansion.</p>","<p>Millions of people die each year in low and middle income countries from conditions that can be diagnosed by microscopy. Conditions from cancer to malaria depend on expert examination of patient samples by an experienced microscopist. Over 600,000 people die each year from malaria alone. The vast majority of these deaths are children under five, in sub-Saharan Africa. Cancer contributes a further 500,000 deaths per year in Africa, giving an annual total of over 1 million deaths per year in Africa from just two conditions which can be routinely diagnosed on a light microscope.</p>
<p>Access to diagnostics is a major health inequality. Without sufficient diagnostic capacity, deadly conditions go undiagnosed until it is too late to save patients' lives. Many efforts have tried to introduce diagnostic technologies into low and middle income countries. However, as these technologies were developed for the highly serviced context of high income countries' hospitals, they fail to save lives in areas with fewer resources and slower supply chains.</p>
<p>Donated equipment often sits idle due to a lack of spare parts, a lack of authorised engineers, and a lack of proprietary consumables. In sub-Saharan Africa, 70-90% of donated medical equipment lies unused. Operating a ""closed shop"" with respect to maintenance, spare parts, and consumables can help to ensure quality and reliability, but it also locks out regions that have not yet reached the purchasing power required to establish local sales and service infrastructure. Ultimately, this entrenches both health and financial inequality, as profits from healthcare technology reside in the rich countries where manufacturers are established.</p>
<p>The rollout of digital microscopy and whole slide imaging has revolutionised diagnostics. Automated digital pathology has not only improved record keeping and training, it also allows telepathology - consultancy with an expert based elsewhere. Automated slide scanning and AI-enabled healthcare are common in clinics in the Global North, but inaccessible in most areas of the world. This represents a disparity between the regions, widening the gap and preventing millions of patients from benefiting from the cutting edge technology employed in high income countries.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure Project takes a radically different approach to providing digital diagnostics to those who need them. We understand that local manufacturers are essential to providing diagnostic infrastructure that can be sustainably maintained. The microscope has been co-designed over 8 years by a diverse team of academics, medical professionals, and local manufacturers in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope is designed to provide a high performance and robust diagnostic solution that can be built and maintained by local manufacturers in the Global South. We have focussed on combining readily available components with custom 3D printed parts, to create an instrument that is easy to manufacture and maintain. The OpenFlexure Microscope employs exactly the same optics used in existing diagnostic microscopes. The high cost of traditional microscopes stems from the cost of specialised components for precise, automated positioning. One of our key technical innovations is a one-piece compliant mechanism that provides this precise positioning even when printed on an entry-level, low-cost 3D printer. Our microscopes have been built and used on all seven continents and in over 50 countries, so we are confident that we have designed a product that can be built in any setting, and our open license gives people and companies confidence to adopt it.</p>
<p>The project has been overwhelmingly successful at enabling the production of laboratory grade microscopes. However, this alone does not save lives. To enable medical diagnostics, the microscope must be available to medical professionals. This requires the local manufacturing partners in our network produce and sell the microscope as a diagnostic device. Diagnostic devices are highly regulated, and so our solution includes providing support and know-how for our partners to navigate (and at times, help develop) the regulatory requirement with producing medical devices at the point of care, rather than importing them.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure project has focussed on creating an entirely open design, where the quality management is both robust and openly auditable. This readily provides the information for any manufacturer to verify the design, and to translate it for manufacturing appropriate for their context. Local engineers are much better placed to tailor products to their own context, overcoming regionally specific issues. This allows manufacturers to address their own challenges, such as allowing the microscope to cope gracefully with power outages, or working with consumables that can be sourced locally rather than requiring imported ones.</p>
<p>Local production builds crucial capacity in regions where diagnostics are unavailable. Local production of microscopes results in more robust medical supply chains, better availability of maintenance and spare parts, and retention of healthcare spending within the growing economies of the Global South. The OpenFlexure project is poised to realise these benefits for microscopy, and once successful will pave the way for a growing range of essential diagnostic technologies to be democratised.</p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/InmLDDsRmb4"">Tech Demo Link here</a><br /></p>","<p>The primary beneficiaries will be patients in underfunded settings. Clinics in the Global South are often unable to perform basic diagnostic tests. This can lead to patients being required to travel hundreds of miles for testing, medics using damaged or improvised equipment, or presumptive treatment, where patients are prescribed scarce and often powerful medication based only on symptoms and patient history. This leads to treatment delays and to misdiagnosis of disease, both which can have deadly consequences. The OpenFlexure Microscope provides high-quality digital diagnostics that are context appropriate and locally certified, manufactured and maintained.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope has been extensively tested for suitability to diagnose malaria, a disease caused by <em>Plasmodium </em>parasites which kills over 600,000 people per year. It has also been shown to be effective at diagnosing many cancers, including breast, oesophageal, and anal. Cancer contributes a further 500,000 deaths per year in sub-Saharan Africa. When diagnostic equipment is available, these conditions are routinely diagnosed, and when diagnosed early, the prognosis is generally positive.</p>
<p>Clinicians will benefit from the OpenFlexure Microscope, as it is able to automatically scan slides, freeing up the clinicians' time for other tasks. The World Health Organisation guidelines can require 100-200 fields of view be searched for a single malaria diagnosis. Automating this searching allows overworked pathologists to instead focus on skilled tasks, including interaction with patients. By purchasing this open design from a local manufacturer, rather than relying on donated equipment, a clinic can control all their microscopes on the same software, reducing the need for retraining on new equipment or maintaining multiple collections of spare parts for different systems. The microscopes will be deployed at the point of care, reducing the delay and cost of testing, and removing the risk of transporting physical glass slides. The OpenFlexure Microscope enables telepathology, designed for the specific challenges of remote communities. Challenges such as power outages, slow or unreliable internet, or untrained users currently limit access to existing telepathology platforms. This will make remote consultancy with experts in other cities or countries instantly accessible, rather than requiring travel or sample transport.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope brings the benefit of digital record keeping to clinics in underserved areas. Digital archives of slides can be backed up remotely and retrieved quickly, providing a reliable and auditable diagnostic history without without the costs and risks of physical slide archival (risk of damage, fading stains, or a lack of physical space). These archived digital samples allow medical training to be performed on virtual slides. Virtual slides can be annotated and accessed on any device, allowing students to learn at their own pace, rather being limited by access to a microscope and suitable samples.</p>
<p>As the OpenFlexure Microscope is designed to be locally manufactured, it benefits both clinics and the wider local economy. Clinics will benefit from access to local engineers for repairs and servicing, vastly increasing equipment up-time. The local economy will benefit from a high-value manufacturing sector creating employment for numerous manufacturing and service engineers.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure project has, since its inception, been co-developed with the communities it will benefit. Component availability differs vastly across the globe, so having a diverse network of manufacturing partners has focussed the project to adopt technologies that are globally appropriate. Our team comprises engineers, medics and software developers from around the world.</p>
<p>The power of a network that spans continents is that we have learned to deal with heat, humidity, power outages, and intermittent supply chains in a way that no team in a single country could. The first test manufacturing run of the 3D printed microscope stage in Tanzania in 2018 produced hundreds of microscope bodies. From these microscopes, and subsequent fatigue testing, we were able to implement processes and controls to navigate the harsh environment that these microscopes will face in the field. </p>
<p>The microscope has now been produced or used on every continent and in over 50 countries. It has been produced thousands of times by engineers, manufacturers, academics and hobbyists, who have never met or interacted with the original design team. We know we have a robust and internationally appropriate design that is both sufficiently high performance for medical diagnosis, and well-engineered enough for diverse environments.</p>
<p>Much of our clinical work to date, carried out by Ifakara Health Institute, Tanzania, used solely microscopes built and maintained in Tanzania, by Tanzanian engineers and technicians. While this work has been overwhelmingly positive, there remains significant effort to build up trust that locally produced diagnostic equipment can equal the quality of imported devices.</p>
<p>Building trust in locally manufactured and maintained devices requires an open, honest, commitment to best practices in the design and manufacturing of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic devices. This is complicated in many countries where the local regulators only have experience in confirming the certification of imported devices. Any work to enable local manufacturing of medical devices must also consider the need for capacity building within local regulatory bodies. Our network has already started this process in Tanzania and Cameroon.</p>
<p>Every aspect of the OpenFlexure Microscope's design has been influenced by its ongoing co-development process. Eight years of global partnerships has created a reliable device that is proven to be robust to the harsh conditions in which it is needed. This is not an academic project looking for global partnership. This is an established global partnership looking to make the final regulatory push to get affordable and appropriate diagnostic devices into the hands of clinicians around the world.</p>","Increase capacity and resilience of health systems, including workforce, supply chains, and other infrastructure.","3. Good Health and Well-Being, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, 12. Responsible Consumption and Production",Prototype,"<p>The project sits on the boundary from prototype to pilot. As a successful open source design, thousands of microscopes have been built and used across the planet by our growing and vibrant community. Our microscopes have been deployed in the pathology department of the University Teaching Hospital of Butare, Rwanda, where they are used for remote training and case review between pathologists in Rwanda and the Texas Medical Center. Locally manufactured microscopes in Tanzania have been used in clinical studies to evaluate their efficacy for malaria diagnosis. Our design has matured significantly over the last 8 years, but it has not yet passed the milestone of being approved for medical use in a particular country.</p>
<p>Regulatory approval is the next milestone that will move us into the pilot phase. Our network has laid the groundwork for this approval with an upcoming major release of a design optimised for manufacturing at scale. Our manufacturing partners in Tanzania (BTech) and Cameroon (Mboalab), are working with local regulators to get the necessary certifications to international medical device manufacturing standards (such as ISO13485), and product-specific certification. Once this certification is in place, they will be able to market the improved diagnostics in their respective countries, initially at pilot stage but rapidly moving towards growth. Once our initial manufacturers have grown their implementations sufficiently, other manufacturers in our network will be able to learn from their success and enable the solution to rapidly scale.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure Project has grown from a small laboratory experiment into a global community project. The network is centred on a robust open source design, and individual partnership agreements between research and business partners for specific funded projects. As our network moves into regulated manufacturing, we have a growing need to formalise the project's governance.</p>
<p>Our network is built around an open hardware model, in which all intellectual property is released under a perpetual, non-exclusive license, that permits commercial use. This empowers local manufacturers by ensuring that they will always be free to use the design without external control by an overseas rights holder. However, this creates a challenge when fundraising due to the unconventional IP model, and the unclear legal relationship between partners within the network.</p>
<p>Supported by MIT Solve, we will establish a nonprofit responsible for equitable project governance, and supporting the relationship between other partners in the network. We are looking for support to help to refine the business model of both our manufacturing partners and the network as a whole. This will be a network built around a principle of openly shared intellectual property, paying partners for finite goods and services as is typically done in successful open source software companies.</p>
<p>Alongside business model development, we are looking for support as we translate the prototype design into a manufactured medical device. This transition will see activity shift from the network developing a single open source design, to us supporting each local manufacturer in setting up compliance and quality procedures, attaining local certifications, and ultimately launching a commercial product.</p>
<p>We believe there is a strong case to be made that the best way to ensure that life saving diagnostics are available in underserved areas is to support local manufacturing. This distributed manufacturing model is novel, especially in the highly regulated domain of medical device manufacturing. But with support from Solve, we are confident that our pilot manufacturing partners in Tanzania (BTech) and Cameroon (Mboalab) will be able to bring a high-quality life-saving product to market in their local communities. The lessons learned from these pilots will give us runway to support other manufacturing partners around the globe, to bring life-saving diagnostic microscopy to communities that desperately need it.</p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Human Capital (e.g. sourcing talent, board development), Legal or Regulatory Matters",Dr Richard Bowman,No,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Word of mouth,<p>Discussing opportunities for support for emerging technologies looking to wider impact outside or alongside academia</p>,"<p>The core technological innovation of the OpenFlexure Microscope is the stage design that allows a low-cost entry-level 3D printer to produce a scientific instrument capable of sub-micron positioning. This design has been iterated openly for 8 years. The project has pioneered a new open source hardware methodology that ensures that all aspects of the design and documentation are openly available, consistent, and clear.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope is one of the first and best examples of open source hardware for medical and scientific applications. It challenges the assumption that medical technology must always be proprietary, secret, and restricted. While restrictive intellectual property and closed-shop service contracts may ensure high quality in rich countries with strong infrastructure, this prevailing business practice excludes most of the Global South. Restricted access to consumables, spare parts, and company-certified technicians makes it impossible to run modern equipment in much of the Global South even when funding is available for the initial purchase. The products available today are also almost exclusively designed for highly serviced locations, relying on stable power, clean air, and solid internet connections. Our model instead empowers local engineers and entrepreneurs to create products that are suited to their context, based on a common well tested design for the core hardware and software required.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Project has not only pioneered in its own practices of design, the project has continued to refine and document its methodology to allow others to follow in its footsteps. The need for locally-manufactured, context appropriate medical equipment was thrown into sharp focus in the first wave COVID-19 pandemic. Despite thousands of engineers devoting thousands of hours to technology development, the impact was underwhelming. Progress was often impeded by a lack of clear methodology for hardware design collaboration, a limited understanding of local and international regulatory frameworks, and limited partnerships between designers and manufacturers. By establishing the OpenFlexure model as a successful pathway to equitable and appropriate local medical manufacturing, we will be better prepared for future medical emergencies.</p>
<p>A growing number of open hardware products have achieved global success, such as RepRap desktop 3D printers and Arduino microcontrollers. Bringing that local empowerment to the highly regulated medical device industry will be transformative. Establishing a medical device industry builds desperately needed capacity in underserved regions, and creates the capability to respond quickly to global medical supply chain disruptions such as those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>","<p>Our specific plan is to advance the OpenFlexure Microscope through the product development lifecycle, to prove the principle of local manufacturing of certified <em>in vitro</em> medical diagnostics. This will have an immediate healthcare impact, helping to diagnose deadly conditions such as malaria. We have already build a robust prototype, and refined this into a stable, mature product that is undergoing clinical evaluation. Our pilot project in Rwanda is already using the microscope for medical education - a region with no previous access to digital pathology is now running remote training sessions from scans from our device.<br /></p>
<p>Our longer-term impact will come through capacity building of manufacturers, regulators, and hospital staff. Our network is currently focussed on supporting our local manufacturing partners in Tanzania and Cameroon to set up quality managed manufacturing and to gain regulatory approval. The benefits of this go beyond the availability of a single product in a specific region. The capacity built will enable our partners and other companies to establish a medical device sector across developing economies.</p>
<p>The power of our solution comes from working openly as a global collaboration. We capture both formal documentation and informal know-how through open repositories and forums, and evaluate our work openly. This is a powerful tool for sharing knowledge, and has led to many new partners joining the network with confidence in the technology. This openness has also allowed third parties to implement and evaluate the technology, for example in the Phillippines [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002070"">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002070</a>], where the OpenFlexure Microscope was independently built and evaluated in a range of clinical scenarios and found to be promising.</p>
<p>Once our partners in Tanzania and Cameroon have successfully brought the microscope to market as a regulated medical device, we are confident that the information needed for other manufacturers to follow in their footsteps will be readily available. As the design and development process has been open since inception, this will provide a roadmap for the distributed design and manufacture of other medical devices.</p>
<p>Stakeholder engagement exercises, including interview, surveys, and workshops, were conducted in Tanzania and Cameroon as part of previous academic projects. These highlighted a local appetite, at government level and within healthcare services, to establish and use local suppliers, as a means to circumvent supply chain difficulties. We have engaged with regulators, particularly Tanzanian Medical Devices Authority, on the subject of approving a locally manufactured microscope. This will be the first such product to be approved by the regulator; currently imports make up the bulk of approved devices. The regulator is keen to develop the process and to see a pipeline of locally developed devices reaching the market. Long-term, the impact of improved regulatory and medical manufacturing capacity will far surpass the impact of any one device.</p>","<p>Our ultimate goal is to end the disparity in access to high quality healthcare services between high and low income countries. Specifically, we need to overcome the most pernicious problem with medical technology in low and middle income countries: supply chains. While the high cost of today's medical technology is a significant barrier, it is the supply chain for spare parts, proprietary consumables, and authorised service personnel that leads to much donated medical equipment lying inoperable.</p>
<p>By establishing local manufacturing of quality-managed medical devices, we can reduce the reliance on unreliable international supply chains. Locally manufactured devices can be locally repaired, and if they are based on open designs they may be serviced, repaired and used even if the manufacturer stops supporting them.</p>
<p>Our solution will lead to improved access to malaria diagnostics for patients, initially in Tanzania and Cameroon. This can be measured by tracking sales and usage of microscopes once products reach the market, allowing us to estimate how many patients have benefited from an improved diagnosis. This metric is only useful once a product has passed regulatory approval, but is a very direct measure of the reach of our solution.</p>
<p>To monitor progress towards regulatory approval, we track development against the Technology Readiness Level scale, which measures the solution's progress from idea to reality. We currently estimate the OpenFlexure Microscope is at TRL 6, having been demonstrated in relevant clinical environments. The TRL scale is relatively coarse-grained, but provides a good way of measuring progress towards the milestone of achieving a marketed medical product.</p>
<p>Longer term, we believe our model will pave the way for both medical microscope production in other low and middle income countries, and will build capacity for the local production of other medical devices to follow. We are able to track both the number of countries where medical microscope production has been established, and the growth of the local medical device industry in countries following the approval of the OpenFlexure Microscope.</p>
<p>As an open project, another significant measure of our impact is the size, diversity, and activity of the our network. That includes both the core developers and manufacturers, and the many people around the world making use of the designs. This is primarily monitored through the project's online forum, where a diverse community of over four hundred people share progress, applications, tips, and improvements. There is also a growing body of academic literature produced by those using the OpenFlexure Microscope in scientific research, assessing its clinical usage, or adapting the design for other uses.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope uses affordable sensors and embedded computing, combined with desktop 3D printing, to implement an advanced automated microscope with readily available off-the-shelf parts and minimal tooling costs.</p>
<p>The precise positioning mechanism was our first step-change innovation, achieving the fine mechanical performance required for a microscope in a structure made orders of magnitude more cheaply. This is done using a three dimensional, monolithic flexure stage. A key enabling technology is desktop 3D printing, specifically the now-ubiquitous fused filament fabrication technology. This enables complex structures to be accurately replicated by a machine costing only a few hundred dollars. OpenFlexure was the first demonstration of 3D printed flexures for precision micropositioning, and its mechanism would be difficult or impossible to manufacture any other way. The intricate, interlocking mechanism enables the OpenFlexure Microscope's sample and focus stages to be small, stiff, and precise - while being fabricated from a few dollars of raw material in a matter of hours. This replaces the more usual machined metal components, which must be manufactured to precise tolerances for bearings to run smoothly - a process that is much more expensive both per item and as an initial start-up cost.</p>
<p>Embedded computing also plays a key role in the OpenFlexure Microscope: the ability to build in edge computing to the device, which follows an Internet of Things architecture, allows us to calibrate and test every device on a regular basis. This permits the use of inexpensive consumer-grade sensors and components, as we can enable exhaustive self-calibration on every microscope. The same embedded computing also allows microscopes to run unattended, and without a dedicated control computer per microscope. This simplifies information technology infrastructure requirements, and frees up valuable technician time for other duties.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope's traction within its growing community is enabled by its open source development and its clear and consistent documentation. As the open source hardware space is considerably less mature than the open source software space, we have needed to develop our own software tooling to enable this accessibility. Our software tooling allows for integrating documentation into the design repository, automatically generating high-quality renderings of assembly steps, and automatically generated bills of materials. This is essential for keeping a complex collaborative design accessible to everyone within our global network. All software to support the design is also released under an open source license, to empower other open hardware projects.</p>",A new technology,"<p>The first academic paper on the OpenFlexure Microscope was published in 2016 [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4941068"">https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4941068</a>]. The microscope comprised a translation stage, a compact and robust optics module, a digital camera, an embedded computer, and software. This paper demonstrated the sub-micron positioning of the flexure stage, and its accurately, repeatability, and stability. A follow up paper in 2020 [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.385729"">https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.385729</a>] demonstrated the significantly improved optical performance, a wider array of imaging capabilities, emerging features such as auto-focus and tile scanning, and a deeper consideration of distributed manufacturing. A paper is currently being written to document the release of a stable design for mass manufacturing.</p>
<p>All components of the microscope have undergone extensive technical evaluation, including peer-reviewed papers on our camera calibration [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.5334/joh.20"">https://doi.org/10.5334/joh.20</a>], our software [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211158"">https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211158</a>], and an our improved auto-focus procedure [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/jmi.13064"">https://doi.org/10.1111/jmi.13064</a>].

<p>Four locally manufactured OpenFlexure Microscopes were in routine use by our technician at Ifakara Health Institute, in Bagamoyo Tanzania for over two years, while others were tested in two smaller Tanzanian clinics. In all settings, malaria parasites were clearly visible to both expert and novice users [paper in preparation]. Evidence of the clinical application of the OpenFlexure Microscope for histopathology include papers evaluating its utility in both Brazil [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stlm.2024.100145"">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stlm.2024.100145</a>] and the Philippines [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002070"">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002070</a>].</p>
<p>In addition to the technology and clinical focussed papers, we have also produced papers focussing on the technical challenges of co-developing medical devices [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46280.2020.9342860"">https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46280.2020.9342860</a>], and on capacity and responsible innovation in medical technology research[<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12340"">https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12340</a>]. A white paper was also produced by the Englelberg Centre for Innovation Law &amp; Policy at the NYU School of Law considering the OpenFlexure Microscope as a case study for distributed manufacturing.</p>
<p>Further papers cover adapting the OpenFlexure Microscope technology for a fixed objective microscope [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.450211"">https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.450211</a>], optical fibre alignment [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.384207"">https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.384207</a>], super-resolution microscopy [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.12688%252Ff1000research.21294.1"">https://doi.org/10.12688%2Ff1000research.21294.1</a>], and optical sectioning microscopy [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.461910"">https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.461910</a>]. These adaptations were produced away from, and often independently of, the core design team. This is the gold standard for any distributed manufacturing project, indicating that the documentation, designs and component choice are all applicable in other settings.</p>
<p>In addition to the evidence in the literature, thousands of OpenFlexure Microscopes have been reproduced by labs and individuals in over 50 countries using our open documentation, verifying that the OFM is a mature, well-tested, and reproducible design.

The project received its first funding six years ago in 2018, at which point the team was able to expand and fund full-time researchers, as well as clinical and manufacturing partners in Tanzania. Our network held its first international gathering (OpenFlexureCon) in 2022, with in-person attendees from Europe, North America, South America, and Africa, and remote participation from Asia.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure Project is not yet a formal entity, although we are advancing plans to adopt a more formal structure including an advisory board. Leadership of the project has been driven by academic funding to date, which was steered by a group including representatives of the local manufacturers, Tanzanian healthcare researchers, UK academics from the physical sciences, and experts in global health research. Our advisory board for the open project will include a diverse range of countries and disciplines, and we will endeavour to recruit a panel that is diverse against other criteria as well.</p>
<p>Equitable partnership has always been at the core of our work, and indeed the whole structure of the project around open licensing and open development was designed to enable meaningful, two-way interaction with a wide range of groups. The success of OpenFlexure so far has been underpinned by the mutually respectful partnerships we have built across disciplines and continents, and sharing ownership of the technology, both formally (through open licensing) and practically (by ensuring different partners are all able to contribute to co-development) has been a key goal. We have also devoted efforts to documenting the challenges and solutions we have encountered and implemented with regard to equitable working in this space [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46280.2020.9342860"">https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46280.2020.9342860</a> and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12340"">https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12340</a>].</p>
<p>Making a project open does not guarantee inclusiveness or equity of access: there are still barriers in terms of skill, culture, and resources to participation. OpenFlexure has adopted a code of conduct[<a href=""https://openflexure.org/conduct/"">https://openflexure.org/conduct/</a>] clarifying expectations of all participants, and setting the tone for respectful and inclusive conversation. Our online forum provides a welcoming way in to the project, removing the technical barrier of interaction through the software-focused GitLab repository. Significant staff time is devoted to answering questions and moderating the forum to ensure it remains an inclusive and supportive environment. On a more technical level, we have also implemented a fully-open software toolchain for every aspect of development. This means there is no barrier to participation based on access to expensive CAD package licenses.</p>","<p>The wider OpenFlexure Project network contains many legal entities each with their own business model. Given their familiarity with their local economy and supply chain, we do not intend to interfere with each local business model. In order to access the medical market, it is necessary to have a product made by a specified ""legal manufacturer"", who is responsible for quality and compliance in a particular country. Our legal manufacturers will be local engineering companies, and their revenue would come from microscope sales, spare parts, and service contracts. We have verified that production of microscopes based on the OpenFlexure design would be financially sustainable, and result in a purchase price that can compete with existing, imported products while offering significant benefits due to local support and improved supply chain resilience.</p>
<p>While non-exclusive intellectual property makes it possible, in principle, for other companies to compete, the regulated medical market is highly quality-sensitive and therefore unlikely to favour cheap imports. Cheap imports wouldn't carry the same certification as from the original manufacturer, and wouldn't be able to offer long term local support and service.</p>
<p>We actively encourage more companies to set up production of products based on the open design for the microscope, but we do not believe this would be an attractive proposition where a local supplier already exists, particularly in the medical space. However, both our pilot medical manufacturing partners are strongly involved in local efforts to grow capacity in high tech products, and have been very supportive of other start-ups bringing related products to market.</p>
<p>One aspect of the business model that needs formalising is how we fund design, development, and project governance in the long-term. We plan to establish a non-profit to govern the project and the design. The business model of this non-profit will be to raise funds from voluntary contributions from manufacturers who rely on the underlying design, and to undertake consultancy/service contracts when new or existing manufacturers need a significant investment of time or resources for training or for specific hardware developments. All IP for the project will remain openly licensed for all.</p>",Organizations (B2B),"<p>The core development team has been funded to date by academic research grants: we have secured around £3M in support of this project since 2018, across the Universities of Bath, Cambridge, and Glasgow. We anticipate some level of academic support will continue, with a growing body of research work relying on the microscope.</p>
<p>We envisage the project will form a lightweight legal entity (most likely a charitable incorporated organisation in the UK and/or a C-Corp in the USA) to provide governance, oversight, and clarity around IP ownership. This entity would have minimal running costs, supported by voluntary royalties from manufacturers and service providers, and contracts for support or consultancy. Most of the activity and financial turnover will happen in the local manufacturing companies.</p>
<p>Local manufacturers have a clear route to sustainability in the form of revenue from product sales and servicing. Initial market research has shown that a sale price of up to £1000 would be competitive with imported products and give a vastly wider feature-set, and that this would yield an acceptable profit margin for the local manufacturer. Service contracts and replacement parts guarantee a continuous income even after facilities have been supplied with microscopes, and indeed those facilities are incentivised to support the company in order to guarantee continuity of support and ensure uptime. We estimate that investment of about £500,000 would be needed to bring the microscope to market as a medical device in either Tanzania or Cameroon. Due to our collaborative network we estimate the investment to establish medical manufacturing in a second country would be £300,000. This would reduce further for subsequent countries, as the network builds capacity and the know-how to ensure quality and support in new regions.</p>
<p>There is also significant scope for microscopes to be provided as part of a diagnostic service, where microscopes and telepathology services are supplied to healthcare facilities without a dedicated expert pathologist. This would ideally take place within a country, for example a large referral hospital providing services to a region or the whole country, but could also be supplemented by international experts providing diagnostics or training services to build domestic capacity.</p>
<p>Whether through a service model or traditional purchasing of products and maintenance, the market for improved diagnostics in Africa is a significant one, with the potential for substantial government contracts and additional income from private facilities and overseas donors. Our model will retain these funds within the countries where manufacturing happens, creating sustainable businesses and growing the high tech economy, as well as providing a healthcare impact.</p>","Challenge Name: 2024 Global Health Equity Challenge
 Provide a one-line summary of your solution.: A locally manufactured high performance digital microscope and slide scanner for medical diagnostics.
 In what city, town, or region is your solution team headquartered?: Glasgow, UK
 In what country is your solution team headquartered?: United Kingdom
 What type of organization is your solution team?: Other, including part of a larger organization (please explain below)
 If you selected Other, please explain here.: The OpenFlexure project began as an academic project. Some of the project core team members are employed at the University of Glasgow and University of Bath. Through research projects, OpenFlexure has been co-developed and tested by research institutions (Ifakara Heath Institute, Tanzania; Baylor College of Medicine, USA) and by a network of small manufacturers, primarily across sub-Saharan Africa. As the OpenFlexure project has matured, and more potential manufacturing partners are onboarded, it is clear that we need to establish a non-profit entity to govern the project. We hope that MIT solve will help us navigate this expansion.
 What specific problem are you solving?: Millions of people die each year in low and middle income countries from conditions that can be diagnosed by microscopy. Conditions from cancer to malaria depend on expert examination of patient samples by an experienced microscopist. Over 600,000 people die each year from malaria alone. The vast majority of these deaths are children under five, in sub-Saharan Africa. Cancer contributes a further 500,000 deaths per year in Africa, giving an annual total of over 1 million deaths per year in Africa from just two conditions which can be routinely diagnosed on a light microscope.
Access to diagnostics is a major health inequality. Without sufficient diagnostic capacity, deadly conditions go undiagnosed until it is too late to save patients' lives. Many efforts have tried to introduce diagnostic technologies into low and middle income countries. However, as these technologies were developed for the highly serviced context of high income countries' hospitals, they fail to save lives in areas with fewer resources and slower supply chains.
Donated equipment often sits idle due to a lack of spare parts, a lack of authorised engineers, and a lack of proprietary consumables. In sub-Saharan Africa, 70-90% of donated medical equipment lies unused. Operating a ""closed shop"" with respect to maintenance, spare parts, and consumables can help to ensure quality and reliability, but it also locks out regions that have not yet reached the purchasing power required to establish local sales and service infrastructure. Ultimately, this entrenches both health and financial inequality, as profits from healthcare technology reside in the rich countries where manufacturers are established.
The rollout of digital microscopy and whole slide imaging has revolutionised diagnostics. Automated digital pathology has not only improved record keeping and training, it also allows telepathology - consultancy with an expert based elsewhere. Automated slide scanning and AI-enabled healthcare are common in clinics in the Global North, but inaccessible in most areas of the world. This represents a disparity between the regions, widening the gap and preventing millions of patients from benefiting from the cutting edge technology employed in high income countries.
 What is your solution?: The OpenFlexure Project takes a radically different approach to providing digital diagnostics to those who need them. We understand that local manufacturers are essential to providing diagnostic infrastructure that can be sustainably maintained. The microscope has been co-designed over 8 years by a diverse team of academics, medical professionals, and local manufacturers in sub-Saharan Africa.
The OpenFlexure Microscope is designed to provide a high performance and robust diagnostic solution that can be built and maintained by local manufacturers in the Global South. We have focussed on combining readily available components with custom 3D printed parts, to create an instrument that is easy to manufacture and maintain. The OpenFlexure Microscope employs exactly the same optics used in existing diagnostic microscopes. The high cost of traditional microscopes stems from the cost of specialised components for precise, automated positioning. One of our key technical innovations is a one-piece compliant mechanism that provides this precise positioning even when printed on an entry-level, low-cost 3D printer. Our microscopes have been built and used on all seven continents and in over 50 countries, so we are confident that we have designed a product that can be built in any setting, and our open license gives people and companies confidence to adopt it.
The project has been overwhelmingly successful at enabling the production of laboratory grade microscopes. However, this alone does not save lives. To enable medical diagnostics, the microscope must be available to medical professionals. This requires the local manufacturing partners in our network produce and sell the microscope as a diagnostic device. Diagnostic devices are highly regulated, and so our solution includes providing support and know-how for our partners to navigate (and at times, help develop) the regulatory requirement with producing medical devices at the point of care, rather than importing them.
The OpenFlexure project has focussed on creating an entirely open design, where the quality management is both robust and openly auditable. This readily provides the information for any manufacturer to verify the design, and to translate it for manufacturing appropriate for their context. Local engineers are much better placed to tailor products to their own context, overcoming regionally specific issues. This allows manufacturers to address their own challenges, such as allowing the microscope to cope gracefully with power outages, or working with consumables that can be sourced locally rather than requiring imported ones.
Local production builds crucial capacity in regions where diagnostics are unavailable. Local production of microscopes results in more robust medical supply chains, better availability of maintenance and spare parts, and retention of healthcare spending within the growing economies of the Global South. The OpenFlexure project is poised to realise these benefits for microscopy, and once successful will pave the way for a growing range of essential diagnostic technologies to be democratised.Tech Demo Link here
 Who does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives? : The primary beneficiaries will be patients in underfunded settings. Clinics in the Global South are often unable to perform basic diagnostic tests. This can lead to patients being required to travel hundreds of miles for testing, medics using damaged or improvised equipment, or presumptive treatment, where patients are prescribed scarce and often powerful medication based only on symptoms and patient history. This leads to treatment delays and to misdiagnosis of disease, both which can have deadly consequences. The OpenFlexure Microscope provides high-quality digital diagnostics that are context appropriate and locally certified, manufactured and maintained.
The OpenFlexure Microscope has been extensively tested for suitability to diagnose malaria, a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites which kills over 600,000 people per year. It has also been shown to be effective at diagnosing many cancers, including breast, oesophageal, and anal. Cancer contributes a further 500,000 deaths per year in sub-Saharan Africa. When diagnostic equipment is available, these conditions are routinely diagnosed, and when diagnosed early, the prognosis is generally positive.
Clinicians will benefit from the OpenFlexure Microscope, as it is able to automatically scan slides, freeing up the clinicians' time for other tasks. The World Health Organisation guidelines can require 100-200 fields of view be searched for a single malaria diagnosis. Automating this searching allows overworked pathologists to instead focus on skilled tasks, including interaction with patients. By purchasing this open design from a local manufacturer, rather than relying on donated equipment, a clinic can control all their microscopes on the same software, reducing the need for retraining on new equipment or maintaining multiple collections of spare parts for different systems. The microscopes will be deployed at the point of care, reducing the delay and cost of testing, and removing the risk of transporting physical glass slides. The OpenFlexure Microscope enables telepathology, designed for the specific challenges of remote communities. Challenges such as power outages, slow or unreliable internet, or untrained users currently limit access to existing telepathology platforms. This will make remote consultancy with experts in other cities or countries instantly accessible, rather than requiring travel or sample transport.
The OpenFlexure Microscope brings the benefit of digital record keeping to clinics in underserved areas. Digital archives of slides can be backed up remotely and retrieved quickly, providing a reliable and auditable diagnostic history without without the costs and risks of physical slide archival (risk of damage, fading stains, or a lack of physical space). These archived digital samples allow medical training to be performed on virtual slides. Virtual slides can be annotated and accessed on any device, allowing students to learn at their own pace, rather being limited by access to a microscope and suitable samples.
As the OpenFlexure Microscope is designed to be locally manufactured, it benefits both clinics and the wider local economy. Clinics will benefit from access to local engineers for repairs and servicing, vastly increasing equipment up-time. The local economy will benefit from a high-value manufacturing sector creating employment for numerous manufacturing and service engineers.
 How are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?: The OpenFlexure project has, since its inception, been co-developed with the communities it will benefit. Component availability differs vastly across the globe, so having a diverse network of manufacturing partners has focussed the project to adopt technologies that are globally appropriate. Our team comprises engineers, medics and software developers from around the world.
The power of a network that spans continents is that we have learned to deal with heat, humidity, power outages, and intermittent supply chains in a way that no team in a single country could. The first test manufacturing run of the 3D printed microscope stage in Tanzania in 2018 produced hundreds of microscope bodies. From these microscopes, and subsequent fatigue testing, we were able to implement processes and controls to navigate the harsh environment that these microscopes will face in the field. 
The microscope has now been produced or used on every continent and in over 50 countries. It has been produced thousands of times by engineers, manufacturers, academics and hobbyists, who have never met or interacted with the original design team. We know we have a robust and internationally appropriate design that is both sufficiently high performance for medical diagnosis, and well-engineered enough for diverse environments.
Much of our clinical work to date, carried out by Ifakara Health Institute, Tanzania, used solely microscopes built and maintained in Tanzania, by Tanzanian engineers and technicians. While this work has been overwhelmingly positive, there remains significant effort to build up trust that locally produced diagnostic equipment can equal the quality of imported devices.
Building trust in locally manufactured and maintained devices requires an open, honest, commitment to best practices in the design and manufacturing of in vitro diagnostic devices. This is complicated in many countries where the local regulators only have experience in confirming the certification of imported devices. Any work to enable local manufacturing of medical devices must also consider the need for capacity building within local regulatory bodies. Our network has already started this process in Tanzania and Cameroon.
Every aspect of the OpenFlexure Microscope's design has been influenced by its ongoing co-development process. Eight years of global partnerships has created a reliable device that is proven to be robust to the harsh conditions in which it is needed. This is not an academic project looking for global partnership. This is an established global partnership looking to make the final regulatory push to get affordable and appropriate diagnostic devices into the hands of clinicians around the world.
 Which dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address?: Increase capacity and resilience of health systems, including workforce, supply chains, and other infrastructure.
 Which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals does your solution address?: 3. Good Health and Well-Being, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, 12. Responsible Consumption and Production
 What is your solution’s stage of development?: Prototype
 Please share details about why you selected the stage above.: The project sits on the boundary from prototype to pilot. As a successful open source design, thousands of microscopes have been built and used across the planet by our growing and vibrant community. Our microscopes have been deployed in the pathology department of the University Teaching Hospital of Butare, Rwanda, where they are used for remote training and case review between pathologists in Rwanda and the Texas Medical Center. Locally manufactured microscopes in Tanzania have been used in clinical studies to evaluate their efficacy for malaria diagnosis. Our design has matured significantly over the last 8 years, but it has not yet passed the milestone of being approved for medical use in a particular country.
Regulatory approval is the next milestone that will move us into the pilot phase. Our network has laid the groundwork for this approval with an upcoming major release of a design optimised for manufacturing at scale. Our manufacturing partners in Tanzania (BTech) and Cameroon (Mboalab), are working with local regulators to get the necessary certifications to international medical device manufacturing standards (such as ISO13485), and product-specific certification. Once this certification is in place, they will be able to market the improved diagnostics in their respective countries, initially at pilot stage but rapidly moving towards growth. Once our initial manufacturers have grown their implementations sufficiently, other manufacturers in our network will be able to learn from their success and enable the solution to rapidly scale.
 Why are you applying to Solve?: The OpenFlexure Project has grown from a small laboratory experiment into a global community project. The network is centred on a robust open source design, and individual partnership agreements between research and business partners for specific funded projects. As our network moves into regulated manufacturing, we have a growing need to formalise the project's governance.
Our network is built around an open hardware model, in which all intellectual property is released under a perpetual, non-exclusive license, that permits commercial use. This empowers local manufacturers by ensuring that they will always be free to use the design without external control by an overseas rights holder. However, this creates a challenge when fundraising due to the unconventional IP model, and the unclear legal relationship between partners within the network.
Supported by MIT Solve, we will establish a nonprofit responsible for equitable project governance, and supporting the relationship between other partners in the network. We are looking for support to help to refine the business model of both our manufacturing partners and the network as a whole. This will be a network built around a principle of openly shared intellectual property, paying partners for finite goods and services as is typically done in successful open source software companies.
Alongside business model development, we are looking for support as we translate the prototype design into a manufactured medical device. This transition will see activity shift from the network developing a single open source design, to us supporting each local manufacturer in setting up compliance and quality procedures, attaining local certifications, and ultimately launching a commercial product.
We believe there is a strong case to be made that the best way to ensure that life saving diagnostics are available in underserved areas is to support local manufacturing. This distributed manufacturing model is novel, especially in the highly regulated domain of medical device manufacturing. But with support from Solve, we are confident that our pilot manufacturing partners in Tanzania (BTech) and Cameroon (Mboalab) will be able to bring a high-quality life-saving product to market in their local communities. The lessons learned from these pilots will give us runway to support other manufacturing partners around the globe, to bring life-saving diagnostic microscopy to communities that desperately need it.
 In which of the following areas do you most need partners or support?: Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Human Capital (e.g. sourcing talent, board development), Legal or Regulatory Matters

 What makes your solution innovative?: The core technological innovation of the OpenFlexure Microscope is the stage design that allows a low-cost entry-level 3D printer to produce a scientific instrument capable of sub-micron positioning. This design has been iterated openly for 8 years. The project has pioneered a new open source hardware methodology that ensures that all aspects of the design and documentation are openly available, consistent, and clear.
The OpenFlexure Microscope is one of the first and best examples of open source hardware for medical and scientific applications. It challenges the assumption that medical technology must always be proprietary, secret, and restricted. While restrictive intellectual property and closed-shop service contracts may ensure high quality in rich countries with strong infrastructure, this prevailing business practice excludes most of the Global South. Restricted access to consumables, spare parts, and company-certified technicians makes it impossible to run modern equipment in much of the Global South even when funding is available for the initial purchase. The products available today are also almost exclusively designed for highly serviced locations, relying on stable power, clean air, and solid internet connections. Our model instead empowers local engineers and entrepreneurs to create products that are suited to their context, based on a common well tested design for the core hardware and software required.
The OpenFlexure Project has not only pioneered in its own practices of design, the project has continued to refine and document its methodology to allow others to follow in its footsteps. The need for locally-manufactured, context appropriate medical equipment was thrown into sharp focus in the first wave COVID-19 pandemic. Despite thousands of engineers devoting thousands of hours to technology development, the impact was underwhelming. Progress was often impeded by a lack of clear methodology for hardware design collaboration, a limited understanding of local and international regulatory frameworks, and limited partnerships between designers and manufacturers. By establishing the OpenFlexure model as a successful pathway to equitable and appropriate local medical manufacturing, we will be better prepared for future medical emergencies.
A growing number of open hardware products have achieved global success, such as RepRap desktop 3D printers and Arduino microcontrollers. Bringing that local empowerment to the highly regulated medical device industry will be transformative. Establishing a medical device industry builds desperately needed capacity in underserved regions, and creates the capability to respond quickly to global medical supply chain disruptions such as those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Describe in simple terms how and why you expect your solution to have an impact on the problem.: Our specific plan is to advance the OpenFlexure Microscope through the product development lifecycle, to prove the principle of local manufacturing of certified in vitro medical diagnostics. This will have an immediate healthcare impact, helping to diagnose deadly conditions such as malaria. We have already build a robust prototype, and refined this into a stable, mature product that is undergoing clinical evaluation. Our pilot project in Rwanda is already using the microscope for medical education - a region with no previous access to digital pathology is now running remote training sessions from scans from our device.
Our longer-term impact will come through capacity building of manufacturers, regulators, and hospital staff. Our network is currently focussed on supporting our local manufacturing partners in Tanzania and Cameroon to set up quality managed manufacturing and to gain regulatory approval. The benefits of this go beyond the availability of a single product in a specific region. The capacity built will enable our partners and other companies to establish a medical device sector across developing economies.
The power of our solution comes from working openly as a global collaboration. We capture both formal documentation and informal know-how through open repositories and forums, and evaluate our work openly. This is a powerful tool for sharing knowledge, and has led to many new partners joining the network with confidence in the technology. This openness has also allowed third parties to implement and evaluate the technology, for example in the Phillippines [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002070], where the OpenFlexure Microscope was independently built and evaluated in a range of clinical scenarios and found to be promising.
Once our partners in Tanzania and Cameroon have successfully brought the microscope to market as a regulated medical device, we are confident that the information needed for other manufacturers to follow in their footsteps will be readily available. As the design and development process has been open since inception, this will provide a roadmap for the distributed design and manufacture of other medical devices.
Stakeholder engagement exercises, including interview, surveys, and workshops, were conducted in Tanzania and Cameroon as part of previous academic projects. These highlighted a local appetite, at government level and within healthcare services, to establish and use local suppliers, as a means to circumvent supply chain difficulties. We have engaged with regulators, particularly Tanzanian Medical Devices Authority, on the subject of approving a locally manufactured microscope. This will be the first such product to be approved by the regulator; currently imports make up the bulk of approved devices. The regulator is keen to develop the process and to see a pipeline of locally developed devices reaching the market. Long-term, the impact of improved regulatory and medical manufacturing capacity will far surpass the impact of any one device.
 What are your impact goals for your solution and how are you measuring your progress towards them?: Our ultimate goal is to end the disparity in access to high quality healthcare services between high and low income countries. Specifically, we need to overcome the most pernicious problem with medical technology in low and middle income countries: supply chains. While the high cost of today's medical technology is a significant barrier, it is the supply chain for spare parts, proprietary consumables, and authorised service personnel that leads to much donated medical equipment lying inoperable.
By establishing local manufacturing of quality-managed medical devices, we can reduce the reliance on unreliable international supply chains. Locally manufactured devices can be locally repaired, and if they are based on open designs they may be serviced, repaired and used even if the manufacturer stops supporting them.
Our solution will lead to improved access to malaria diagnostics for patients, initially in Tanzania and Cameroon. This can be measured by tracking sales and usage of microscopes once products reach the market, allowing us to estimate how many patients have benefited from an improved diagnosis. This metric is only useful once a product has passed regulatory approval, but is a very direct measure of the reach of our solution.
To monitor progress towards regulatory approval, we track development against the Technology Readiness Level scale, which measures the solution's progress from idea to reality. We currently estimate the OpenFlexure Microscope is at TRL 6, having been demonstrated in relevant clinical environments. The TRL scale is relatively coarse-grained, but provides a good way of measuring progress towards the milestone of achieving a marketed medical product.
Longer term, we believe our model will pave the way for both medical microscope production in other low and middle income countries, and will build capacity for the local production of other medical devices to follow. We are able to track both the number of countries where medical microscope production has been established, and the growth of the local medical device industry in countries following the approval of the OpenFlexure Microscope.
As an open project, another significant measure of our impact is the size, diversity, and activity of the our network. That includes both the core developers and manufacturers, and the many people around the world making use of the designs. This is primarily monitored through the project's online forum, where a diverse community of over four hundred people share progress, applications, tips, and improvements. There is also a growing body of academic literature produced by those using the OpenFlexure Microscope in scientific research, assessing its clinical usage, or adapting the design for other uses.
 Describe the core technology that powers your solution.: The OpenFlexure Microscope uses affordable sensors and embedded computing, combined with desktop 3D printing, to implement an advanced automated microscope with readily available off-the-shelf parts and minimal tooling costs.
The precise positioning mechanism was our first step-change innovation, achieving the fine mechanical performance required for a microscope in a structure made orders of magnitude more cheaply. This is done using a three dimensional, monolithic flexure stage. A key enabling technology is desktop 3D printing, specifically the now-ubiquitous fused filament fabrication technology. This enables complex structures to be accurately replicated by a machine costing only a few hundred dollars. OpenFlexure was the first demonstration of 3D printed flexures for precision micropositioning, and its mechanism would be difficult or impossible to manufacture any other way. The intricate, interlocking mechanism enables the OpenFlexure Microscope's sample and focus stages to be small, stiff, and precise - while being fabricated from a few dollars of raw material in a matter of hours. This replaces the more usual machined metal components, which must be manufactured to precise tolerances for bearings to run smoothly - a process that is much more expensive both per item and as an initial start-up cost.
Embedded computing also plays a key role in the OpenFlexure Microscope: the ability to build in edge computing to the device, which follows an Internet of Things architecture, allows us to calibrate and test every device on a regular basis. This permits the use of inexpensive consumer-grade sensors and components, as we can enable exhaustive self-calibration on every microscope. The same embedded computing also allows microscopes to run unattended, and without a dedicated control computer per microscope. This simplifies information technology infrastructure requirements, and frees up valuable technician time for other duties.
The OpenFlexure Microscope's traction within its growing community is enabled by its open source development and its clear and consistent documentation. As the open source hardware space is considerably less mature than the open source software space, we have needed to develop our own software tooling to enable this accessibility. Our software tooling allows for integrating documentation into the design repository, automatically generating high-quality renderings of assembly steps, and automatically generated bills of materials. This is essential for keeping a complex collaborative design accessible to everyone within our global network. All software to support the design is also released under an open source license, to empower other open hardware projects.

 How do you know that this technology works?: The first academic paper on the OpenFlexure Microscope was published in 2016 [https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4941068]. The microscope comprised a translation stage, a compact and robust optics module, a digital camera, an embedded computer, and software. This paper demonstrated the sub-micron positioning of the flexure stage, and its accurately, repeatability, and stability. A follow up paper in 2020 [https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.385729] demonstrated the significantly improved optical performance, a wider array of imaging capabilities, emerging features such as auto-focus and tile scanning, and a deeper consideration of distributed manufacturing. A paper is currently being written to document the release of a stable design for mass manufacturing.
All components of the microscope have undergone extensive technical evaluation, including peer-reviewed papers on our camera calibration [https://doi.org/10.5334/joh.20], our software [https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211158], and an our improved auto-focus procedure [https://doi.org/10.1111/jmi.13064]. Further papers are in the pipeline evaluating our automated scanning and image tiling technology.
Four locally manufactured OpenFlexure Microscopes were in routine use by our technician at Ifakara Health Institute, in Bagamoyo Tanzania for over two years, while others were tested in two smaller Tanzanian clinics. In all settings, malaria parasites were clearly visible to both expert and novice users [paper in preparation]. Evidence of the clinical application of the OpenFlexure Microscope for histopathology include papers evaluating its utility in both Brazil [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stlm.2024.100145] and the Philippines [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002070].
In addition to the technology and clinical focussed papers, we have also produced papers focussing on the technical challenges of co-developing medical devices [https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46280.2020.9342860], and on capacity and responsible innovation in medical technology research[https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12340]. A white paper was also produced by the Englelberg Centre for Innovation Law &amp; Policy at the NYU School of Law considering the OpenFlexure Microscope as a case study for distributed manufacturing.
