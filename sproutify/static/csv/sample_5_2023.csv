In Africa, access to healthcare is a significant challenge, particularly in countries like Nigeria where only about 10% of the population is covered by health insurance. This leads to most healthcare expenses being paid out of pocket, often resulting in catastrophic financial consequences for families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this puts an estimated 15 million individuals into extreme poverty every year and results in about 30% of households in Nigeria having to resort to borrowing money or selling assets to pay for healthcare expenses.</p>
<p>Our solution focuses on increasing local capacity and resilience in health systems, enabling informed interventions and decision-making, improving accessibility and quality of health services for underserved groups, and enabling continuity of care. The scale of the problem affects over 1.6 billion people globally, with communities in fragile contexts being disproportionately impacted. CribMD leverages technology and innovation to address systemic and institutional inequities, governance and coordination challenges, and ensure comprehensive health-related data is available to inform decisions.</p>
<p>Our solution includes a telemedicine platform, doctor home visits, and micro insurance to reach marginalized and displaced populations. Our telemedicine platform provides remote consultations and diagnoses, enabling patients in remote and underserved areas to receive care without having to travel long distances to health facilities. Our doctor home visit service provides on-demand access to healthcare services, particularly for those with mobility limitations or who are unable to travel to health facilities. Our micro insurance solution helps to mitigate the financial burden of healthcare expenses and protects families from financial hardship in the event of unexpected health events.</p>
<p>In addition to improving access to healthcare, CribMD also addresses systemic and institutional inequities in the healthcare sector by enabling informed interventions and decision-making. Our platform provides real-time data and analytics on health indicators and trends, enabling health workers and policymakers to make informed decisions and allocate resources more effectively. </p>
<p>Our inclusive, human-centered design approach ensures that the solution is tailored to meet the needs of the communities we serve. Our partnerships with relevant stakeholders, including government agencies, health providers, and local organizations, are critical to scaling our solution and bringing affordable and accessible healthcare to communities globally.</p>
<p>To measure the impact of our solution, we will track key indicators such as increased access to healthcare for marginalized populations, improved health outcomes, reduced healthcare costs for families, and increased resilience in health systems. Our solution has the potential to make a significant impact, particularly in fragile contexts where access to healthcare is limited and the need is greatest. Through our innovative approach, inclusive human-centered design, and partnerships with relevant stakeholders, we aim to scale our solution and bring affordable and accessible healthcare to communities globally, positively impacting the lives of over 1.6 billion people.</p>","<p>Walking Doctors (WD) offers an easy to use, comprehensive, cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) that uniquely incorporates evidence-based treatment protocols available in multiple languages (presently English, Spanish, French and Indonesia). WD’s EHR is specifically designed to address the challenges of accessibility, availability, usability, and quality faced by providers in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs): </p>
<p>1. A library of best practice treatment algorithms.</p>
<p>WD drives providers to exceed WHO standards and SMART methodology through routine use of over 200 evidence-based disease and condition algorithms, elegantly restructured into electronic checklists. In WD’s EHR, checklists guide providers to record pertinent negative and positive findings, to send confirmatory studies, to order medicines at the right dose and to conclude visits with patient education. Providers at all levels benefit from SMART checklists which make correct choices easy while sustaining patient throughput. In a country like Senegal, where busy healthcare workers have less formal medical education, access to a library of dynamic, integrated and professional checklists can transform care.</p>
<p>2. Real-time feedback. </p>
<p>WDs EHR tells clinicians at the point of care how they are doing via a red-light, green-light quality signalling system. Clicking a quality status bar displays a decision tree that highlights correctly documented steps or deviations from protocol logic. This includes failure to enter a patient’s respiratory rate or prescription of the wrong class of antibiotics. This last stage of WHOs SMART methodology reinforces to health staff the most contemporary standards for not just ANC, but for all of the most important diseases and conditions, allowing for care correction (and improved outcomes) along with increased staff satisfaction regarding routine delivery of high-quality care.</p>
<p>3. A rich medical record. </p>
<p>As clinical staff confirm signs, symptoms and treatment steps, a detailed medical record is automatically created. The online nature and detail in the record enables typical uses such as quick access to patient histories, exams and laboratory results, but also novel ones such as anonymised research, automated notification of sentinel events, documentation of health disparities, and real-time epidemic monitoring when there is preponderance of symptoms.</p>
<p>4. Integrated Pharmacy Management. </p>
<p>WD has a complete pharmacy management module that includes, clinic formulary, dosing, drug inventories, stock-keeping, pricing and report writing. There is no need to use competing software. Dramatically improved pharmacy management is imperative in public health centers, which run their own pharmacies, where medicines are often over-prescribed and stocked-out during emergencies.</p>
<p>5. Data and Systems integration. </p>
<p>Within security controls, all of the data in the WD system can be exported or integrated with health databases, including DHIS-2 using FIHR or other standards.</p>
<p>6. Off-line functionality. </p>
<p>Connectivity in the world is increasingly ubiquitous but still there are places and times when the internet turns off. When this happens, WD utilizes local hotspots to allow devices to continue sharing and interfacing. When internet connection is reestablished, locally stored data is beamed back into the cloud. WD is built with state of the art application design principles, allowing it to run on networks with limited bandwidth.</p>","<p>Sinthian Clinic on Senegal’s easternmost border with Mauritania and Mali as well as Wassadou Clinic in Senegal’s Tambacounda Region which neighbors Gambia are the two sites this grant will serve. The proximity of these clinics to the porous borders of its neighboring countries puts WD’s EHR at the heart of Senegal’s most exposed populations to the destabilization of climate change, migration, and conflict. This is expressed in dismal maternal and child mortality rates: 1 in 317 Senegalese mothers die during childbirth and 38 of 1,000 children will not live to celebrate their 1st birthday. In the U.S., these ratios are 1 in 33,000 and 3 of 1,000, respectively. </p>
<p>Wassadou Clinic, a primary care facility, serves a cachment of 20,000 people. Though Wassadou is a private facility, public healthcare infrastructure in the region is insufficient. By law, all activities in Wassoudou are reported to Senegal's Ministry of Health in the form of reports painstakingly gathered from paper medical records.</p>
<p>Sinthian Clinic’s doctors, midwives and nurses see more than 12,000 patients a year. Thousands of villagers are reliant on Sinthian for their primary care which in 2021 recorded 14,000 visits. EHR access for Sinthian providers and patients alike would be transformative and serve as a model for many similarly distanced healthcare facilities in sub-Saharan Africa where the lights (and internet) are commonly turned off. Sinthian like Wassoudou exclusively employs handwritten medical records.</p>
<p>Although Senegal retains a largely stable democracy, the 40-year insurgency in the Casamance region to the west of Wassadou also poses challenges. As a result, WD’s EHR will operate to not only strengthen these health systems, but build the coping capacity to manage the adverse conditions posed by their locations. The nature of an EHR system like WD is that it can impact care across an entire  geographic area. WD’s EHR checklists enable protocol adherence when providing urgent care under pressure without compromising quality.</p>
<p>With NGO partner Le Korsa, WD is committed to reversing dismal health trends for patients throughout Senegal. The diversity across Senegal’s context and people will demand multi-pronged solutions, but all will require concurrent continuous application of the best clinical decision support and health system management tools. This is WD's EHR.</p>","<p>The project brings together a rich and diverse set of individuals with expertise in emergency and primary care, health system strengthening, software development, and data science.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson Wang, founder and CEO of Walking Doctors, is a pediatrician based out of New York. Walking Doctor’s foundation story evolved over a decade in Sub-Saharan Africa, culminating in the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic and the difficulties in managing both accurate patient care and wider public health information needs. Dr. Wang, then working for the International Rescue Committee, saw first-hand how every aspect of the Ebola response was impacted by the interplay of poor record-keeping, low standards of supportive clinical care in treatment units, high mortality rates, lack of community trust, poor uptake of public health messaging, and insufficient data sharing and action (Time, 2014). Fast forward 8 years: Walking Doctors produces the only EHR for LMICs engineered for quality defined as effective, efficient and equitable patient-centered care.</p>
<p>Allegra Tsongo is the CEO of Le Korsa, an international NGO that has worked out of Senegal supporting health care projects in the country for over a decade. Le Korsa sponsors Keur Djiguene Yi Women and Children's Clinic in Dakar, a current user of WDs EHR. It also sponsors Sinthian and Wassadou in Eastern Senegal— the sites of this project— the only health facilities within 3 hours of the nearest regional hospitals.</p>
<p>Sinthinan and Wassadou serve 40 to 50 patients a day under the leadership of Dr. Magueye Ba who dreams of an EHR to both support and magnify his team's essential work. Currently, there is no reliable internet in the region. While the project presents a tested electronic health record to Dr. Ba (in French!), the modern flexible build of WD’s EHR will allow him to create his own patient surveys, customize performance dashboards, automate government health data reports and formally task shift work to nursing staff and community health workers by sharing access to diagnostic and treatment checklists on a system that works on a smartphone. For the first time, Dr. Ba will have stock management capability, billing support and visualization of staff work intensity, frequency and location.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry in Senegal is initiating efforts to install electronic health records in primary and secondary healthcare facilities. The Ministry has green lighted the pilot of WD's EHR in the aforementioned contexts with a focus on testing automated and high-quality secure data sharing into its new national health information repository.</p>
<p>Joaquin Budiaman, Senior Engineer, is in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Joaquin is a full stack hacker, meaning he can code from all sides of the system, developing content that is intuitive and pleasing to users while making sure data is securely and expertly organized for storage, access and use.</p>
<p>A 6-person Clinical Advisory Board provides critical contributions to WD's EHR checklist content. Board members are highly respected and accomplished international healthcare experts from Harvard, Hopkins, the Navy and UCSF.</p>","Improve accessibility and quality of health services for underserved groups in fragile contexts around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, LGBTQ+ individuals, etc.)","3.

Partnerships for the Goals","Growth: An organization with an established product, service, or business model that is rolled out in one or more communities",,"<p>NOVEL TECHNOLOGY IN TRADITIONAL PLACES</p>
<p>WD proposes that MIT/SOLVE spur the pace of healthcare improvement by subsidizing the project’s EHR customisation costs, which includes off-line functionality, composition of automated health reports and integration with Health Ministry data relays; as well as implementation costs which will involve 4 person local and international team training and supporting Wassadou and Sinthian clinic, each for 1 week. This eliminates key barriers to EHR adoption while giving health leadership first-hand experience and rationale to continue subscriptions beyond the initial period of support, which takes time to budget. While WD’s modest subscription fee pays for itself over and over again, EHR adjustment and training fees are needed to incentivise health systems leaders who currently operate without even a basic EHR, and who may be slow to realize the value proposition of quality-focused data management systems against competing work demands. WD’s EHR is as complete as one will find in LMICs, but like all new technology, it requires adjustment to local care culture to increase staff buy-in and acceptability. This will now include off-line functionality via local hotspots, excellent UX on a simple smartphone and use by less formally trained health providers including community health workers</p>
<p>IMMATURE LOCAL DATA REGULATIONS</p>
<p>Walking Doctors operates under the highest standards of data security. It applies U.S. patient privacy (HIPAA) standards as a baseline. Patient data is stored in the cloud at dual AWS sites in case there is a data breach or black out. WD’s CTO is a data security expert. And WD will never sell its data to marketers. Yet, electronic health data management capacity in LMICs is nascent, which commonly leads to Health Ministries stalling innovations in data sharing for lack of standards on patient data definition, format, transfer and storage. MIT/ SOLVE undoubtedly has experience working with Health Ministries on health innovations that do not compromise data privacy and security, while working on codifying standards when not present. WD would welcome such a prestigious company in elaborating Health Information System requirements.</p>
<p>REACH</p>
<p>Walking doctor wants to increase availability and accessibility to its one-of-a-kind quality focused EHR but knows that it cannot do it alone. WD was incorporated in 2018 as a Delaware C-corps to ease product development and speed implementation, but this unpredictably closed off the company to  NGOs, Foundations and Ministries. The MIT Solve opportunity is a trisector opportunity, one where sector labels give way to partnership realities, where the singular objective is to dramatically improve human health and health system performance every day is necessary to ease real human suffering as  well as to prepare for novel threats.</p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors)",,,,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,,Other (please specify),<p>The MIT/SOLVE opportunity was advertised on the Gates Grand Challenges list-serv</p>,"<p>WD’s electronic health record (EHR) is an interface in which the multifaceted levels and moving parts of health systems, from patient interaction to measurement of clinical effectiveness, become a collective continuum of care. Human experiences in health systems are at the center of WD’s EHR design. Indeed, WDs EHR was initially designed by a physician then continuously improved through feedback from users and purchasers. <br /></p>
<p>At the clinical level, WD’s checklists encapsulate and streamline steps from the construction of medical notes for patient history and diagnosis to coordination with the necessary staff and departments for continuity of care. Using the checklist as the primary care-relay, the EHR produces cohesive instructions for the nurses on what labs to draw and deliver, for the pharmacy on what prescriptions (with the correct dosing) to dispense, for the provider on essential discharge instructions, and onward, keeping track of essential actions in the process of care delivery. The net effect is to increase health provider adherence to protocols from 35% to 85% across all major diseases and conditions and to decrease overuse of medicines by 50%. These same results will be attainable by regions currently off the Internet grid— over 50% of Senegal’s outpatient clinics— with WD’s novel offline functionality.</p>
<p>At the administrative level, WD’s EHR signals when there is a death, when drug inventories fall low, and when disease incidence is too high. In Senegal, when a doctor writes a prescription it must be physically run over to the Pharmacy. If the prescription is for antibiotics or intravenous fluids, the patient must first pay for it! These are just two examples of the usefulness of even pharmacy data: The stories they tell provide the impetus and means for change.</p>
<p>At the system level, all data in the WD system can be passively exported and integrated with Ministry health databases, including DHIS-2 using FIHR. WDs automatic data exchange build can become a model in a country which still relays health data to the Ministry via excel. Also,WD’s data organisation allows health leaders to see who is sick, with what, to what consequence and where— in real time. Data displays further empowered by GIS-visualisation are not only essential to managing today’s disease burdens but in detecting aberrations in condition prevalence which presage epidemics. </p>
<p>In sum, WD’s EHR is an innovative approach for fragile contexts because it offers software, features and processes essential for any high functioning healthcare system. Furthermore, when fragile contexts crumble, destabilising events can arguably be predicted and responded to before crisis, so long as technology is constantly applied to support effective and efficient care with the data to prove it. This includes giving insight and practice into change strategies that are essential in peacetime, and out. WD EHR is this kind of technology.</p>",,"<p>The goal of this project is to increase adherence to health protocols proven to safe lives. To achieve this, we will ensure that health providers refer to evidence-based protocols during the course of outpatient care. In turn, health leadership will share high-quality health services and clinical results data with the Ministry of Health, quarterly.</p>

<p>KPI 3d. Qualitative study</p>","<p>In the WD system, checklists are the way health providers document and act on patient care decisions. This strategy aligns with behavioral health theory whereby decisions can be positively influenced by making the correct choice obvious (through explicit presentation of protocols), employing some degree of peer pressure (users know their performance is being measured and compared) and making the sum of work easier (through checklist integrations)</p>
<p>The electronic health record (EHR) vehicle WD uses is created with java script, the language of the internet, meaning access to WDs EHR is easy and ubiquitous. In this project, we provide off-line technology through local solar/battery powered hotspots, but ultimately comprehensive care data is shared in the cloud.</p>
<p>EHRs contain sensitive data. From its inception WD Engineering has made it a policy to adhere to the highest standards of data security, system availability and patient privacy, exceeding typical standards used in the healthcare industry in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>This is a summary of some key practices. <br /></p>
<p>Reliability Practices</p>
<p>·      Data must be stored in at least two geographically distinct data centers and be durable in the event of one of the data centers becoming unavailable for any reason</p>
<p>·      Every data processing subsystem must be composed of multiple individual resources that are located in at least two geographically distinct data centers. Such subsystems must be designed to survive the unavailability of a single data center.</p>
<p>·      Network connections into Walking Doctors systems should terminate as close to the end user as possible.</p>
<p>·      Customer data must be separated such that data resources for customers may be operated independently of each other.</p>
<p>Security Practices</p>
<p>·      All data, (including medical data) must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.</p>
<p>·      All cloud systems involved in data processing must be configured in accordance with the Cloud Security Policy.</p>
<p>·      Customer and staff logins to our applications use cryptographically signed, expiring access tokens that can be revoked.</p>
<p>·      Customer passwords must be evaluated on the basis of an estimated password strength of “Safely Unguessable” as determined by the Zxcvbn password strength estimation algorithm.</p>
<p>·      Employee and contractor passwords must be evaluated on the basis of an estimated password strength of “Very Unguessable” as determined by the Zxcvbn password strength estimation algorithm.</p>
<p>·      Where possible, medical data must be cryptographically signed by users that last updated the data. </p>
<p>·      We employ automatic systems for detection, notification and remediation of software vulnerabilities, as well as manual review of system changes.</p>
<p>Privacy Practices</p>
<p>·      Access to patient data is not granted by default to customer users, but rather granted explicitly by a customer user with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>·      Employee and contractor system access must be granted and reviewed in accordance with the Access Control Policy.</p>
<p>·      Access to patient data by Walking Doctors employees and contractors is made on a least authority basis. By default, only the CEO, CTO and senior members of the Operations team have access to patient data for the purposes of system’s monitoring and maintenance only.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER ACQUISITION</p>
<p>In the for-profit sector, customer acquisition is the best test of product functionality. </p>
<p>1) Alight just chose WDs EHR over an established long standing alternative</p>
<p>2) WD was a featured presenter at IMNCH2023 in Capetown this May garnering praise and followup conversation with Ministry representatives from Nigeria and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>3) Senegal's Ministry has green-lighted this EHR initiative over competitors because no other EHR including OpenMRS can provide similar value in terms of comprehensiveness of features and low price. For a separate initiative in its 2 largest hospitals, the Ministry has already approved a $30K a year subscription fee for each of the two hospitals following an initial period of USAID funded customisation, trainer or trainers and implementation support.</p>
<p><br /></p>","Big Data, GIS and Geospatial Technology, Software and Mobile Applications",,"Indonesia,Liberia,Senegal","Ethiopia,Indonesia,Liberia,Nigeria,Senegal,Somalia",Full time 5. Part time 2.,"Walking Doctors was Incoporated in January, 2018.","<p>The checklists which form the basis of Walking Doctors (WD) electronic health record (EHR) directly address disparities in care for women, girls and minorities through care standardization. For example, HIV and TB checklists simplify complicated testing, medicinal regimens, and follow-up protocols for the most marginalized groups, ensuring high quality care even for rare diseases typically managed by non-specialists.</p>
<p>Additionally, WD's EHR captures protected and anonymised structured data for public health and analytics. Such data, which includes minorities and those with varying socioeconomic status, has enormous potential for new forms of analysis on disease prevalence and characteristics. This will be a rich resource for doctors, public health departments, ministries, and researchers typically confronted with data accuracy and collection challenges, which thwart understanding of healthcare disparities in the first place.</p>
<p>The burden of global health disparities is multiplied by the intersectionality of disadvantage in which poverty, gender, sexuality, and race become compounding factors in a person’s health. With WD’s EHR, populations made vulnerable by their intersecting burdens are provided quality care suited to diverse needs. In this way, WD’s EHR re-imagines health equity in the most underserved parts of the world, alleviating the burden of structural violence which defines health systems in both LMICs and HICs. WD’s EHR is a critical first step towards health equity.</p>
<p>WDs CEO is a person of color. WDs Medical Director is Muslim, Indonesian and a woman. Four of six of WDs clinical advisors are underrepresented minorities and half of them women. Walking Doctors foundation story narrates a first-ever attempt to bring a quality-engineered electronic health record to the world's poorest citizens. The fight for global health equity is at the core of WD's mission to provide quality care anywhere.</p>","<p>In 2019, Walking Doctors successfully completed an 18 month pilot of its cloud-based, quality-focused electronic health record (EHR) in Pakpak Bharat, Indonesia—a District of 50,000 residents in remote northern Sumatra. In doing this, WD transitioned all 7 District Health Centers from paper medical records to an EHR, decreased registration time from 20 to 5 minutes, increased chart completeness from 1% to 95% and improved adherence to protocols from 35% to 85%-- across all diseases. The Governor of Pakpak Bharat was so pleased with the results including savings from a 50% reduction in unnecessary prescriptions that he built WD subscription costs into the District's budget for three years. This provided proof-of-concept for Walking Doctors' SaaS business model, even when working with governments. </p>
<p>That WD could work in the harsh conditions of Pakpak Bharat gave WD confidence to expand to Indonesia’s bustling capital of Jakarta with its 10 million residents. WD recruited 10 private clinics and dental offices each representing about 5 thousand patients to use its EHR. Then Covid-19 hit. The challenging nature of in-person implementations and a new decree mandating that all 60,000 outpatient clinics use an EHR led to the development of a new self-sign up process with electronic payment and 100% contactless training via embedded help videos and intuitive UX. This implementation model will be tested in Indonesia before June with the potential to magnify sales in and outside of Indonesia.</p>
<p>In February 2022, the NGO Le Korsa began using WD’s EHR at its free women and children’s clinic Keur Djigeune Yi in Dakar, Senegal. The success of this project brought Le Korsa and WD together as partners for a USAID proposal to bring electronic health records into the Capitol's two busiest hospitals. Up to this point, the government of Senegal has been unable to develop or find an affordable, customizable EHR that impacted care outcomes. In seeing the WD product (in French no less), the Health Ministry committed to purchasing follow-on subscriptions which it did not find expensive, though the project would be first supported by a bilateral grant.</p>
<p>WD continues to aspire towards global impact. It is collaborating with the NGO Alight to implement WDs EMR in clinics in Somalia in Somali (WD is already offered in French, Spanish, Indonesia and English) within a B2B model.</p>",Individual consumers or stakeholders (B2C),"<p>Walking Doctors follows a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenue model, whereby facilities pay for EHR subscriptions (and computers) from their own operational budgets as opposed to being provided them as grants. This uniquely addresses the typical sustainability dilemma of innovation adoption in LMIC. 80% of WD users continue their subscriptions past two years. Subscription costs are calculated from several factors and are vastly more affordable compared to existing systems that require infrastructure, data management, and additional support staff.</p>
<p>Still, help with subscription fees increases the pace of technology adoption. This eliminates the number one barrier to EHR uptake -- money -- while giving healthcare leadership first-hand experience, rationale and lead-time to continue subscriptions beyond the initial support period, which takes time to budget. 80% of WD subscribers maintain their subscriptions beyond two years. point mirrors WD’s previous experience in Indonesia: Concurrent with two years placing and supporting use of EHRs in Pakpak Bharat, WD worked with the District Health Officer and Governor to secure funding for WD EHR subscriptions to 7 health centers for 3 years. The pact was celebrated on May 17, 2018 signing with explicit negotiation that if international investment delivered on purported objectives, it would be matched by domestic investment on future value.</p>
<p>In short, once health facilities start using WD's EHR, users (and patients) quickly become aware of the indispensable nature of a checklist-focused, user-centered and modern electronic health record.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge proposal discusses Walking Doctors' (WD) initiative to improve healthcare in Senegal by addressing several problems that contribute to poor health outcomes, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). The solution proposed is a comprehensive, cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) system designed with off-line functionality to ensure accessibility in remote or internet-challenged areas. This EHR system incorporates evidence-based treatment protocols in multiple languages, integrates a library of over 200 disease and condition algorithms, real-time feedback mechanisms, pharmacy management modules, and capabilities for data and system integration. The technology is in the Growth stage, currently serving facilities in Indonesia, Liberia, and Senegal, and planning expansions into Somalia and Ethiopia, reaching an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 individuals by 2024.

WD’s EHR specifically targets underserved regions and populations, including clinics near Senegal's borders where health resources are scarce, and the insurgency in the Casamance region poses additional challenges. The proposed solution aims to serve two clinics in Senegal: the Sinthian Clinic and the Wassadou Clinic, engaging with these facilities to improve health outcomes significantly by enhancing healthcare delivery's quality and efficiency.

The team behind Walking Doctors is described as diverse, bringing together expertise across emergency and primary care, health system strengthening, software development, and data science. This multidisciplinary team includes pediatrician Dr. Wilson Wang, CEO of Walking Doctors, and various international healthcare experts contributing to the EHR's content development and implementation.

WD operates on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenue model, where healthcare facilities pay subscription fees for using the EHR. This model has proved viable, with WD sustaining subscriptions beyond pilot implementations and planning for substantial growth and expansion. Walking Doctors anticipates increasing its reach and impact by facilitating the adoption of its EHR system in more clinics and health centers in Senegal and LMICs, aiming to dramatically improve patient care, healthcare efficiency, and public health outcomes.

The solution aligns with multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and demonstrates a measured and data-driven approach towards achieving its impact goals. Walking Doctors utilizes advanced technology, including big data, GIS, and cloud storage, for data security and system reliability, ensuring that the EHR system is both powerful and protective of patient privacy.",Walking Doctors,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The proposal is complete, intelligible, and appropriate.

These regions have experienced an armed conflict since 2017 with over 4000 people killed, over 400,000 internally displaced and at least 80,000 externally displaced into neighbouring Nigeria. This has resulted in disruption and massive closure of health facilities, poor access to health services for the displaced rural populations, and health providers fleeing the conflict zone. The displaced population has moved into very remote informal settlements, which are considered safe from warring parties of the crisis. Unfortunately, in these informal settings, there are no basic amenities like housing, water, sanitation, health care services or schools. Access to these informal settlements is exceedingly difficult and there are no established economic activities for the displaced women to make a living and support their families. This displaced population is subject to poverty, lack, and poor health and this has significantly increased the morbidity and mortality rate of this population, especially maternal, infant and childhood mortalities from common preventable, infectious diseases and injuries. The displaced population is also living in a very fragile security situation because they are often involved in the crossfire and constant attacks by the warring parties, especially in their efforts to travel and seek basic healthcare in health facilities in neighbouring towns.

<p><br /></p>","<p>Following lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increasing evidence that quality health care can be provided to individuals, families and communities remotely through telehealth/telemedicine programs. Additionally, evidence from the Extension for Community Health Outcome (ECHO) project implemented by the University of New Mexico and the AIDS Educational Training Centers (AETC) in the NW of the USA, has shown that capacity can be transferred from more specialized complex health settings to very remote, resource-limited settings using Community Health workers (CHWs) to obtain high-quality health outcomes for the community.<br /></p>
<p>Based on both models (Telemedicine and ECHO), Hi4D plan to implement a telemedicine and ECHO solution, to provide continuous and good quality health care to over 250,000 displaced population in informal settings, resulting from the armed crisis in Cameroon, especially targeting women and children. This model will identify community health workers (CHWs) living within the displaced population, train, and mentor them through the ECHO model and use them to provide health promotion and preventive medical services to the population. Hi4D has an established partnership agreement with the ECHO project of the University of New Mexico.</p>
<p>In addition, the solution will also use a telemedicine model with the FHL Medical Center hub to provide specialized medical care to individuals and families in informal settings using the hub and spoke model. The CHWs will be guided to set up spoke sites in these informal settlements with basic telephone and mobile internet connection to link up with specialists' medical providers in the FHL hub to guide targeted individualized medical care to members of the displaced settlement. </p>","<p>The population that this solution will serve are a sizable proportion of the over 400,000 displaced people from the armed crisis who are now living in informal settlements. Specifically, women and children in this population will be targeted for preventive and curative medical services. This population is currently living in extremely poor hygienic conditions with congestion and poor sewage disposal, no portable water supply, poor environmental conditions, and no economic activities to improve their nutrition and environmental conditions. They are exposed to both environmental and nutritional predictors of poor health and injuries. This solution will seek to reduce their environmental exposure through health promotion, health education and prevention intervention through the Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) model. Prevention of disease interventions like proper waste disposal, treatment of water, immunization for children, malaria prevention with insecticide-treated nets, condom distribution and antenatal care for pregnant women will be capital in this solution through health education and working with the local Department of Health to supply basic commodities. Prevention will also focus on screening for TB, and multi-disease screening for chronic conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and HIV, using trained and mentored community health workers. Key community stakeholders (traditional healers, and community leaders) will be engaged in these health promotion and prevention activities.<br />For persons in this population who are already suffering from any disease condition, the telemedicine solution will help to provide diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these patients, using the FHL Medical Centre telemedicine unit as the hub and CHWs setting up and coordinating a satellite health post in the communities as spokes. Hi4D will help with the identification and setting up of satellite telehealth posts in five informal settlements hosting the most displaced populations.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2018-march-2019/crisis-worsens-cameroon"">https://www.un.org/africarenew...</a>).  This has resulted in the disruption of economic and health activities, closure of hospitals, fleeing of health providers from the crisis, and population displaced to informal settlements with no access to health services. The most affected populations are women and children because their families have been killed in the crisis or have joined the militia leaving them to flee to safe havens. These women have lost their source of livelihood, are forced to become head of the household, have no economic activities in these new settlements and have no basic amenities for health, water, and sanitation services. Consequently, they have engaged in trading sex or other illegal acts as a means of sustaining their families. </p>
<p>The government has no means of reaching these populations due to poor transport, and insecurity and no basic services are planned for these informal settlements. </p>
<p>With the insecurity/poor access, we plan to implement an ECHO and telemedicine solution to provide continuous and quality healthcare to the displaced population targeting women and children. This model will identify community health workers (CHWs) living within these settlements, train and use them to implement and monitor preventive, curative, chronic care and rehabilitative health services in five selected displaced communities hosting most of the internally displaced women and children. Hi4D has an affiliated FHL Medical Centre with a pool of general and specialist clinicians that provide holistic medical care in the SW region and has a fully developed and functional telemedicine unit. Leveraging the widespread mobile phone/ internet network access in the country, this technology will be exploited to implement the telemedicine solution. Community stakeholders (community leaders and religious leaders with decision-making authorities in the communities) will be used to sensitize and mobilize the population within these settlements. Trained CHWs will set up megaphones at community venues where public health specialists can broadcast health promotion messages. Meanwhile, clients identified within the settlement with specific disease conditions will be consulted and offered expert treatment using the telemedicine model by the clinical/specialist team. </p>
<p>The solution will coordinate with the local Health Departments for basic public health services (immunization, hygiene, water, and sanitation), provision of medical supplies, and essential medications through an established route using local bikers. Local and international developmental partners (UNICEF, World Food Program) will be contacted to provide basic supplies to these displaced populations.</p>
<p>Telemedicine had been proven to be highly effective in providing quality health care remotely and this approach became widespread during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This target population primarily consists of women and children who now reside in informal settlements without basic amenities, including healthcare services. The initiative plans to deploy a combined approach utilizing the Extension for Community Health Outcome (ECHO) model and telemedicine to deliver comprehensive health services. This approach leverages the partnership with the ECHO project of the University of New Mexico and the FHL Medical Center hub for telemedicine services. 

Community Health Workers (CHWs), who are part of the displaced populations, will be trained and mentored to provide health promotion, preventive medical services, and act as intermediaries for specialized medical care via telemedicine. The solution sets to reach 50,000 displaced individuals annually with preventive and educational health services and aims to provide curative, chronic, and rehabilitative services to 5,000 patients per year through telemedicine, totaling 25,000 patients in five years.

The solution's impact targets align with several UN Sustainable Development Goals, mainly focusing on Good Health and Well-being. Progress will be measured using routine data collection tools integrated into a software system for tracking various health indicators, such as maternal and under-5 mortality rates, disease prevention, and access to healthcare services.

The project is at the Pilot stage, proposing to test the model with a small group of users in five selected informal settlements hosting significant populations of internally displaced persons. The team involves local stakeholders, the Hi4D ECHO team, the FHL Medical Centre's telemedicine unit, trained CHWs, and other development partners. The solution leverages mobile telephony and internet coverage to facilitate health service delivery in remote, insecure areas.

Financial sustainability is a key concern as the service is free for beneficiaries, relying on donor funding for setup and maintenance. The engagement of the Ministry of Health and local health departments is seen as critical for ensuring long-term sustainability and ownership beyond the initial donor funding phase.
