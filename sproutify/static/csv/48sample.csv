70423,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Semi-Finalist,"We built an electronic health record (EHR) that supports quality wherever medicine is practiced, whether this be in remote Wassadou at Senegal's border with Guinea or MiniMe Pediatrics in busy Jakarta. WD EHR users panic when the internet shuts off. That's why we're building an off-line version!","<p>In the Senegalese healthcare system, the intersection of unmet need, overstretched resources, and inefficient processes lead, as in many low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC), to poor health outcomes that disproportionately impact those living in or near poverty. For the 67.5% of Senegalese citizens who survive on less than $3.20 a day, poor health outcomes feed well-documented vicious cycles of prolonged work absences, physical disability, protracted illness, debilitating stress and overwhelming financial impacts on families when members fall sick. </p>
<p>Walking Doctors (WD) seeks to simultaneously address several complimentary problems that contribute to resource scarcity and poor health outcomes in the context of patient care. First, doctors face enormous workloads due to high patient-to-provider ratios. In Senegal there is 1 doctor per 1000 people. In comparison there are 58 doctors per 10,000 people in the UK – a difference of 64 times. Second, providers are inherently challenged to remember the diagnosis and treatments for thousands of diseases and drugs. In combination, these factors mean that patients often receive the wrong treatment. In low and middle income countries (LMICs) like Senegal, more than 50% of post-diagnosis medical care is delivered contrary to the medical evidence-base with an astounding 4 of every 10 patients harmed (WHO).</p>
<p>Third, clinical resources are wasted through the mismanagement of stocks and supply chains for medicines and supplies. For bilateral programs in sub-Saharan Africa, 25% of supplies are routinely unaccounted for or lost. </p>
<p>Finally, the vast majority of Senegal’s 1,347 medical facilities employ almost exclusively paper medical record keeping. This causes multiple problems. Efficiency wise, health staff lose precious time searching for records, re-taking histories, trying to decipher illegible notes, and tracking studies. More seriously, lack of visibility into clinical performance prevents quality improvement. So, while Covid-19 killed 2,000 Senegalese, in the same period more than 100,000 Senegalese children under 5 years died of treatable non-Covid illness.</p>
<p>Walking Doctors' (WD) electronic health record system specifically addresses these problems by coordinating health leadership, data collection, patient-provider interactions, and accurate diagnostics around quality care. Regularly and consistently practiced every day, this will prepare Senegal for novel threats, which will come one day.</p>","<p>Walking Doctors (WD) offers an easy to use, comprehensive, cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) that uniquely incorporates evidence-based treatment protocols available in multiple languages (presently English, Spanish, French and Indonesia). WD’s EHR is specifically designed to address the challenges of accessibility, availability, usability, and quality faced by providers in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs): </p>
<p>1. A library of best practice treatment algorithms.</p>
<p>WD drives providers to exceed WHO standards and SMART methodology through routine use of over 200 evidence-based disease and condition algorithms, elegantly restructured into electronic checklists. In WD’s EHR, checklists guide providers to record pertinent negative and positive findings, to send confirmatory studies, to order medicines at the right dose and to conclude visits with patient education. Providers at all levels benefit from SMART checklists which make correct choices easy while sustaining patient throughput. In a country like Senegal, where busy healthcare workers have less formal medical education, access to a library of dynamic, integrated and professional checklists can transform care.</p>
<p>2. Real-time feedback. </p>
<p>WDs EHR tells clinicians at the point of care how they are doing via a red-light, green-light quality signalling system. Clicking a quality status bar displays a decision tree that highlights correctly documented steps or deviations from protocol logic. This includes failure to enter a patient’s respiratory rate or prescription of the wrong class of antibiotics. This last stage of WHOs SMART methodology reinforces to health staff the most contemporary standards for not just ANC, but for all of the most important diseases and conditions, allowing for care correction (and improved outcomes) along with increased staff satisfaction regarding routine delivery of high-quality care.</p>
<p>3. A rich medical record. </p>
<p>As clinical staff confirm signs, symptoms and treatment steps, a detailed medical record is automatically created. The online nature and detail in the record enables typical uses such as quick access to patient histories, exams and laboratory results, but also novel ones such as anonymised research, automated notification of sentinel events, documentation of health disparities, and real-time epidemic monitoring when there is preponderance of symptoms.</p>
<p>4. Integrated Pharmacy Management. </p>
<p>WD has a complete pharmacy management module that includes, clinic formulary, dosing, drug inventories, stock-keeping, pricing and report writing. There is no need to use competing software. Dramatically improved pharmacy management is imperative in public health centers, which run their own pharmacies, where medicines are often over-prescribed and stocked-out during emergencies.</p>
<p>5. Data and Systems integration. </p>
<p>Within security controls, all of the data in the WD system can be exported or integrated with health databases, including DHIS-2 using FIHR or other standards.</p>
<p>6. Off-line functionality. </p>
<p>Connectivity in the world is increasingly ubiquitous but still there are places and times when the internet turns off. When this happens, WD utilizes local hotspots to allow devices to continue sharing and interfacing. When internet connection is reestablished, locally stored data is beamed back into the cloud. WD is built with state of the art application design principles, allowing it to run on networks with limited bandwidth.</p>","<p>Sinthian Clinic on Senegal’s easternmost border with Mauritania and Mali as well as Wassadou Clinic in Senegal’s Tambacounda Region which neighbors Gambia are the two sites this grant will serve. The proximity of these clinics to the porous borders of its neighboring countries puts WD’s EHR at the heart of Senegal’s most exposed populations to the destabilization of climate change, migration, and conflict. This is expressed in dismal maternal and child mortality rates: 1 in 317 Senegalese mothers die during childbirth and 38 of 1,000 children will not live to celebrate their 1st birthday. In the U.S., these ratios are 1 in 33,000 and 3 of 1,000, respectively. </p>
<p>Wassadou Clinic, a primary care facility, serves a cachment of 20,000 people. Though Wassadou is a private facility, public healthcare infrastructure in the region is insufficient. By law, all activities in Wassoudou are reported to Senegal's Ministry of Health in the form of reports painstakingly gathered from paper medical records.</p>
<p>Sinthian Clinic’s doctors, midwives and nurses see more than 12,000 patients a year. Thousands of villagers are reliant on Sinthian for their primary care which in 2021 recorded 14,000 visits. EHR access for Sinthian providers and patients alike would be transformative and serve as a model for many similarly distanced healthcare facilities in sub-Saharan Africa where the lights (and internet) are commonly turned off. Sinthian like Wassoudou exclusively employs handwritten medical records.</p>
<p>Although Senegal retains a largely stable democracy, the 40-year insurgency in the Casamance region to the west of Wassadou also poses challenges. As a result, WD’s EHR will operate to not only strengthen these health systems, but build the coping capacity to manage the adverse conditions posed by their locations. The nature of an EHR system like WD is that it can impact care across an entire  geographic area. WD’s EHR checklists enable protocol adherence when providing urgent care under pressure without compromising quality.</p>
<p>With NGO partner Le Korsa, WD is committed to reversing dismal health trends for patients throughout Senegal. The diversity across Senegal’s context and people will demand multi-pronged solutions, but all will require concurrent continuous application of the best clinical decision support and health system management tools. This is WD's EHR.</p>","<p>The project brings together a rich and diverse set of individuals with expertise in emergency and primary care, health system strengthening, software development, and data science.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson Wang, founder and CEO of Walking Doctors, is a pediatrician based out of New York. Walking Doctor’s foundation story evolved over a decade in Sub-Saharan Africa, culminating in the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic and the difficulties in managing both accurate patient care and wider public health information needs. Dr. Wang, then working for the International Rescue Committee, saw first-hand how every aspect of the Ebola response was impacted by the interplay of poor record-keeping, low standards of supportive clinical care in treatment units, high mortality rates, lack of community trust, poor uptake of public health messaging, and insufficient data sharing and action (Time, 2014). Fast forward 8 years: Walking Doctors produces the only EHR for LMICs engineered for quality defined as effective, efficient and equitable patient-centered care.</p>
<p>Allegra Tsongo is the CEO of Le Korsa, an international NGO that has worked out of Senegal supporting health care projects in the country for over a decade. Le Korsa sponsors Keur Djiguene Yi Women and Children's Clinic in Dakar, a current user of WDs EHR. It also sponsors Sinthian and Wassadou in Eastern Senegal— the sites of this project— the only health facilities within 3 hours of the nearest regional hospitals.</p>
<p>Sinthinan and Wassadou serve 40 to 50 patients a day under the leadership of Dr. Magueye Ba who dreams of an EHR to both support and magnify his team's essential work. Currently, there is no reliable internet in the region. While the project presents a tested electronic health record to Dr. Ba (in French!), the modern flexible build of WD’s EHR will allow him to create his own patient surveys, customize performance dashboards, automate government health data reports and formally task shift work to nursing staff and community health workers by sharing access to diagnostic and treatment checklists on a system that works on a smartphone. For the first time, Dr. Ba will have stock management capability, billing support and visualization of staff work intensity, frequency and location.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry in Senegal is initiating efforts to install electronic health records in primary and secondary healthcare facilities. The Ministry has green lighted the pilot of WD's EHR in the aforementioned contexts with a focus on testing automated and high-quality secure data sharing into its new national health information repository.</p>
<p>Joaquin Budiaman, Senior Engineer, is in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Joaquin is a full stack hacker, meaning he can code from all sides of the system, developing content that is intuitive and pleasing to users while making sure data is securely and expertly organized for storage, access and use.</p>
<p>A 6-person Clinical Advisory Board provides critical contributions to WD's EHR checklist content. Board members are highly respected and accomplished international healthcare experts from Harvard, Hopkins, the Navy and UCSF.</p>","Improve accessibility and quality of health services for underserved groups in fragile contexts around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, LGBTQ+ individuals, etc.)",New York City,United States,"Growth: An organization with an established product, service, or business model that is rolled out in one or more communities",,"<p>WD's EHR now runs in 8 healthcare facilities in Indonesia including 2 dental offices and 1 pediatric practice in Jakarta; In Liberia's only pediatric Diabetes Type I clinic in Monrovia; and as of 2022, in Keur Djiguene Yi, a free Woman and Children's Health Center in Dakar, Senegal - WD's first operation in French! WD is currently negotiating work with Alight in Somalia and Ethiopia for an expected reach of 50,000 and 100,000 in 2024.</p>","<p>NOVEL TECHNOLOGY IN TRADITIONAL PLACES</p>
<p>WD proposes that MIT/SOLVE spur the pace of healthcare improvement by subsidizing the project’s EHR customisation costs, which includes off-line functionality, composition of automated health reports and integration with Health Ministry data relays; as well as implementation costs which will involve 4 person local and international team training and supporting Wassadou and Sinthian clinic, each for 1 week. This eliminates key barriers to EHR adoption while giving health leadership first-hand experience and rationale to continue subscriptions beyond the initial period of support, which takes time to budget. While WD’s modest subscription fee pays for itself over and over again, EHR adjustment and training fees are needed to incentivise health systems leaders who currently operate without even a basic EHR, and who may be slow to realize the value proposition of quality-focused data management systems against competing work demands. WD’s EHR is as complete as one will find in LMICs, but like all new technology, it requires adjustment to local care culture to increase staff buy-in and acceptability. This will now include off-line functionality via local hotspots, excellent UX on a simple smartphone and use by less formally trained health providers including community health workers</p>
<p>IMMATURE LOCAL DATA REGULATIONS</p>
<p>Walking Doctors operates under the highest standards of data security. It applies U.S. patient privacy (HIPAA) standards as a baseline. Patient data is stored in the cloud at dual AWS sites in case there is a data breach or black out. WD’s CTO is a data security expert. And WD will never sell its data to marketers. Yet, electronic health data management capacity in LMICs is nascent, which commonly leads to Health Ministries stalling innovations in data sharing for lack of standards on patient data definition, format, transfer and storage. MIT/ SOLVE undoubtedly has experience working with Health Ministries on health innovations that do not compromise data privacy and security, while working on codifying standards when not present. WD would welcome such a prestigious company in elaborating Health Information System requirements.</p>
<p>REACH</p>
<p>Walking doctor wants to increase availability and accessibility to its one-of-a-kind quality focused EHR but knows that it cannot do it alone. WD was incorporated in 2018 as a Delaware C-corps to ease product development and speed implementation, but this unpredictably closed off the company to  NGOs, Foundations and Ministries. The MIT Solve opportunity is a trisector opportunity, one where sector labels give way to partnership realities, where the singular objective is to dramatically improve human health and health system performance every day is necessary to ease real human suffering as  well as to prepare for novel threats.</p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors)","No, Solve is the first network joined",,Other (please specify),<p>The MIT/SOLVE opportunity was advertised on the Gates Grand Challenges list-serv</p>,"<p>WD’s electronic health record (EHR) is an interface in which the multifaceted levels and moving parts of health systems, from patient interaction to measurement of clinical effectiveness, become a collective continuum of care. Human experiences in health systems are at the center of WD’s EHR design. Indeed, WDs EHR was initially designed by a physician then continuously improved through feedback from users and purchasers. <br /></p>
<p>At the clinical level, WD’s checklists encapsulate and streamline steps from the construction of medical notes for patient history and diagnosis to coordination with the necessary staff and departments for continuity of care. Using the checklist as the primary care-relay, the EHR produces cohesive instructions for the nurses on what labs to draw and deliver, for the pharmacy on what prescriptions (with the correct dosing) to dispense, for the provider on essential discharge instructions, and onward, keeping track of essential actions in the process of care delivery. The net effect is to increase health provider adherence to protocols from 35% to 85% across all major diseases and conditions and to decrease overuse of medicines by 50%. These same results will be attainable by regions currently off the Internet grid— over 50% of Senegal’s outpatient clinics— with WD’s novel offline functionality.</p>
<p>At the administrative level, WD’s EHR signals when there is a death, when drug inventories fall low, and when disease incidence is too high. In Senegal, when a doctor writes a prescription it must be physically run over to the Pharmacy. If the prescription is for antibiotics or intravenous fluids, the patient must first pay for it! These are just two examples of the usefulness of even pharmacy data: The stories they tell provide the impetus and means for change.</p>
<p>At the system level, all data in the WD system can be passively exported and integrated with Ministry health databases, including DHIS-2 using FIHR. WDs automatic data exchange build can become a model in a country which still relays health data to the Ministry via excel. Also,WD’s data organisation allows health leaders to see who is sick, with what, to what consequence and where— in real time. Data displays further empowered by GIS-visualisation are not only essential to managing today’s disease burdens but in detecting aberrations in condition prevalence which presage epidemics. </p>
<p>In sum, WD’s EHR is an innovative approach for fragile contexts because it offers software, features and processes essential for any high functioning healthcare system. Furthermore, when fragile contexts crumble, destabilising events can arguably be predicted and responded to before crisis, so long as technology is constantly applied to support effective and efficient care with the data to prove it. This includes giving insight and practice into change strategies that are essential in peacetime, and out. WD EHR is this kind of technology.</p>","<p>YEAR ONE</p>
<p>The project will achieve two primary outcomes: Significant adherence to protocols proven to save lives across the top 10 diseases and conditions impacting each of maternal, child and neonatal cohorts (though WD features over 200 checklists) and routine utilisation of performance tools by District and Ministry leadership to drive health system improvement.</p>
<p>Walking Doctors offers an electronic health record (EHR) uniquely built to increase compliance to medical protocols, avoiding errors in care and preventable death. 30% of all deaths in low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC) can be prevented by access to primary care, but only if delivered effectively (Lancet, 2018). Accordingly, we will raise documented care effectiveness by 100% at Le Korsa's clinics of Wassadou and Sinthian and two public primary care facilities of the government's choice. </p>
<p>That’s at the patient-provider level. WD’s build produces protected and anonymised structured-data for public health. Such data, stratified by geography, gender, ethnicity and indicators of socioeconomic status has enormous potential to inform health care programming. Accordingly, district Ministries will then be able to routinely utilise data automatically transferred from WD’s EHR during health planning meetings. When necessary Senegal's Health Ministry will be able to rapidly disseminate information and adjustment to care protocols for evolving threats through additions and adjustments to WD checklists, which the project will track.</p>
<p>YEARS 1-5</p>
<p>Based on year one successes, we plan to rapidly expand EHR use throughout Senegal through meetings, presentations, advertisement and word of mouth with a target of 1.5 million patients cared for by primary care providers using a checklist-based EHR. This corresponds to about 300 clinics and health centers from a total of ~1,200 primary facilities of which 25% are private.</p>
<p>With 2 million patients receiving high quality primary care, this means in Senegal at least1485 lives saved. This likely underestimates WD's impact as we expect other EHR vendors to imitate WD EHR methodology including in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia. To WD, there is more than enough work to share!</p>
<p>Finally, public facilities typically adopt innovations of the private sector, not the other way around. So another measured objective of this proposal is for at least 50% of the increase in primary health care clinics during years 1-5 using WD's EHR will occur in public primary clinics and health centers.</p>","3. Good Health and Well-being, 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 17. Partnerships for the Goals","<p>The goal of this project is to increase adherence to health protocols proven to safe lives. To achieve this, we will ensure that health providers refer to evidence-based protocols during the course of outpatient care. In turn, health leadership will share high-quality health services and clinical results data with the Ministry of Health, quarterly.</p>

<p>KPI 3d. Qualitative study</p>","<p>WDs electronic health record (EHR) dramatically improves health provider adherence to clinical protocols proven to reduce suffering and death without slowing down care. In short, WD provides low and middle income countries (LMIC) access to a resource essential to healthcare strengthening and oversight at an affordable cost, fundamentally challenging the low-bar standard typically laid out for LMIC health systems. </p>
<p>We achieve this by having doctors and health staff work through evidence-based algorithmic checklists which bolster patient care capacity while informing best practice. Checklists work across all industries – from the complex and high-stakes aviation industry to the ubiquitous fast-food industry – because their format is logical and familiar, and they can apply to healthcare too. Within individual medical fields, this has been shown to be true: Surgery (Gawande), Intensive Care Deep line placement (BMC Infect Dis. 2018 Jun 8;18(1):267), and neonatal feeding (Annals of Global Health Jun 2014. 80[3]). Why not deploy checklists in the support of care for all diseases and conditions? WD is the answer to this question.</p>
<p>WD’s EHR is a mechanism for changing health outcomes, care quality, and systems efficiency. But it begins with implementation through collaboration and engagement. This system is made powerful by the people behind it, so its uptake by providers is key. Transitions from paper to electronic record keeping can be radical in resource poor settings, but also because changes in systems require a rewiring of operations through practitioner behavior changes. The development of trust and mutual engagement in WD’s EHR implementation is the first step in the sustainability of its success. </p>
<p>WD’s EHR is also a mechanism for structural change. The impact of WD’s EHR extends beyond the confines of its immediate operations. Unstructured health records leave leaders in the dark on the extent of problems and ways to solve them. WD’s EHR gathers information that can paint a picture of how health systems are more than a sum of patient-provider interactions; revealing resource deprivation, health inequity and care gaps, as well as the socioeconomic drivers of ill health. With WD’s EHR, systems level changes can create population and community health improvements. Outcomes like greater care-seeking behavior, fewer economic shocks to families from extended disease costs or inability to work, improved maternal and child mortality statistics, as well as improved investments in education and social equity for women and girls are all possible with WD’s EHR.</p>
<p>WD’s EHR is also a mechanism for long term changes that strengthen health systems and build resilience. These changes take improvement a step beyond quality care and into disaster preparedness, response and recovery. By improving the quality of care and health outcomes, WD’s EHR gets ahead of tipping points in destabilisation. IN short, WD’s EHR exposes systemic risk, the interactions and relationships in the ecosystem of health that can be catalysts for  systems collapse. This knowledge puts health systems at an advantage, creating a map of itself from which to build up its own capacity to navigate the evolving threats in disease and disaster.</p>","<p>In the WD system, checklists are the way health providers document and act on patient care decisions. This strategy aligns with behavioral health theory whereby decisions can be positively influenced by making the correct choice obvious (through explicit presentation of protocols), employing some degree of peer pressure (users know their performance is being measured and compared) and making the sum of work easier (through checklist integrations)</p>
<p>The electronic health record (EHR) vehicle WD uses is created with java script, the language of the internet, meaning access to WDs EHR is easy and ubiquitous. In this project, we provide off-line technology through local solar/battery powered hotspots, but ultimately comprehensive care data is shared in the cloud.</p>
<p>EHRs contain sensitive data. From its inception WD Engineering has made it a policy to adhere to the highest standards of data security, system availability and patient privacy, exceeding typical standards used in the healthcare industry in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>This is a summary of some key practices. <br /></p>
<p>Reliability Practices</p>
<p>·      Data must be stored in at least two geographically distinct data centers and be durable in the event of one of the data centers becoming unavailable for any reason</p>
<p>·      Every data processing subsystem must be composed of multiple individual resources that are located in at least two geographically distinct data centers. Such subsystems must be designed to survive the unavailability of a single data center.</p>
<p>·      Network connections into Walking Doctors systems should terminate as close to the end user as possible.</p>
<p>·      Customer data must be separated such that data resources for customers may be operated independently of each other.</p>
<p>Security Practices</p>
<p>·      All data, (including medical data) must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.</p>
<p>·      All cloud systems involved in data processing must be configured in accordance with the Cloud Security Policy.</p>
<p>·      Customer and staff logins to our applications use cryptographically signed, expiring access tokens that can be revoked.</p>
<p>·      Customer passwords must be evaluated on the basis of an estimated password strength of “Safely Unguessable” as determined by the Zxcvbn password strength estimation algorithm.</p>
<p>·      Employee and contractor passwords must be evaluated on the basis of an estimated password strength of “Very Unguessable” as determined by the Zxcvbn password strength estimation algorithm.</p>
<p>·      Where possible, medical data must be cryptographically signed by users that last updated the data. </p>
<p>·      We employ automatic systems for detection, notification and remediation of software vulnerabilities, as well as manual review of system changes.</p>
<p>Privacy Practices</p>
<p>·      Access to patient data is not granted by default to customer users, but rather granted explicitly by a customer user with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>·      Employee and contractor system access must be granted and reviewed in accordance with the Access Control Policy.</p>
<p>·      Access to patient data by Walking Doctors employees and contractors is made on a least authority basis. By default, only the CEO, CTO and senior members of the Operations team have access to patient data for the purposes of system’s monitoring and maintenance only.</p>

<p>In the for-profit sector, customer acquisition is the best test of product functionality. </p>
<p>1) Alight just chose WDs EHR over an established long standing alternative</p>
<p>2) WD was a featured presenter at IMNCH2023 in Capetown this May garnering praise and followup conversation with Ministry representatives from Nigeria and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>3) Senegal's Ministry has green-lighted this EHR initiative over competitors because no other EHR including OpenMRS can provide similar value in terms of comprehensiveness of features and low price. For a separate initiative in its 2 largest hospitals, the Ministry has already approved a $30K a year subscription fee for each of the two hospitals following an initial period of USAID funded customisation, trainer or trainers and implementation support.</p>

<p>Additionally, WD's EHR captures protected and anonymised structured data for public health and analytics. Such data, which includes minorities and those with varying socioeconomic status, has enormous potential for new forms of analysis on disease prevalence and characteristics. This will be a rich resource for doctors, public health departments, ministries, and researchers typically confronted with data accuracy and collection challenges, which thwart understanding of healthcare disparities in the first place.</p>
<p>The burden of global health disparities is multiplied by the intersectionality of disadvantage in which poverty, gender, sexuality, and race become compounding factors in a person’s health. With WD’s EHR, populations made vulnerable by their intersecting burdens are provided quality care suited to diverse needs. In this way, WD’s EHR re-imagines health equity in the most underserved parts of the world, alleviating the burden of structural violence which defines health systems in both LMICs and HICs. WD’s EHR is a critical first step towards health equity.</p>
<p>WDs CEO is a person of color. WDs Medical Director is Muslim, Indonesian and a woman. Four of six of WDs clinical advisors are underrepresented minorities and half of them women. Walking Doctors foundation story narrates a first-ever attempt to bring a quality-engineered electronic health record to the world's poorest citizens. The fight for global health equity is at the core of WD's mission to provide quality care anywhere.</p>","<p>In 2019, Walking Doctors successfully completed an 18 month pilot of its cloud-based, quality-focused electronic health record (EHR) in Pakpak Bharat, Indonesia—a District of 50,000 residents in remote northern Sumatra. In doing this, WD transitioned all 7 District Health Centers from paper medical records to an EHR, decreased registration time from 20 to 5 minutes, increased chart completeness from 1% to 95% and improved adherence to protocols from 35% to 85%-- across all diseases. The Governor of Pakpak Bharat was so pleased with the results including savings from a 50% reduction in unnecessary prescriptions that he built WD subscription costs into the District's budget for three years. This provided proof-of-concept for Walking Doctors' SaaS business model, even when working with governments. </p>
<p>That WD could work in the harsh conditions of Pakpak Bharat gave WD confidence to expand to Indonesia’s bustling capital of Jakarta with its 10 million residents. WD recruited 10 private clinics and dental offices each representing about 5 thousand patients to use its EHR. Then Covid-19 hit. The challenging nature of in-person implementations and a new decree mandating that all 60,000 outpatient clinics use an EHR led to the development of a new self-sign up process with electronic payment and 100% contactless training via embedded help videos and intuitive UX. This implementation model will be tested in Indonesia before June with the potential to magnify sales in and outside of Indonesia.</p>
<p>In February 2022, the NGO Le Korsa began using WD’s EHR at its free women and children’s clinic Keur Djigeune Yi in Dakar, Senegal. The success of this project brought Le Korsa and WD together as partners for a USAID proposal to bring electronic health records into the Capitol's two busiest hospitals. Up to this point, the government of Senegal has been unable to develop or find an affordable, customizable EHR that impacted care outcomes. In seeing the WD product (in French no less), the Health Ministry committed to purchasing follow-on subscriptions which it did not find expensive, though the project would be first supported by a bilateral grant.</p>
<p>WD continues to aspire towards global impact. It is collaborating with the NGO Alight to implement WDs EMR in clinics in Somalia in Somali (WD is already offered in French, Spanish, Indonesia and English) within a B2B model.</p>",Individual consumers or stakeholders (B2C),"<p>Walking Doctors follows a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenue model, whereby facilities pay for EHR subscriptions (and computers) from their own operational budgets as opposed to being provided them as grants. This uniquely addresses the typical sustainability dilemma of innovation adoption in LMIC. 80% of WD users continue their subscriptions past two years. Subscription costs are calculated from several factors and are vastly more affordable compared to existing systems that require infrastructure, data management, and additional support staff.</p>
<p>Still, help with subscription fees increases the pace of technology adoption. This eliminates the number one barrier to EHR uptake -- money -- while giving healthcare leadership first-hand experience, rationale and lead-time to continue subscriptions beyond the initial support period, which takes time to budget. 80% of WD subscribers maintain their subscriptions beyond two years. point mirrors WD’s previous experience in Indonesia: Concurrent with two years placing and supporting use of EHRs in Pakpak Bharat, WD worked with the District Health Officer and Governor to secure funding for WD EHR subscriptions to 7 health centers for 3 years. The pact was celebrated on May 17, 2018 signing with explicit negotiation that if international investment delivered on purported objectives, it would be matched by domestic investment on future value.</p>
<p>In short, once health facilities start using WD's EHR, users (and patients) quickly become aware of the indispensable nature of a checklist-focused, user-centered and modern electronic health record.</p>","<p>The success of Walking Doctors 18-month pilot in 2018-2019 of its electronic health record in 7 Health Centers in Sumatra, Indonesia resulted in a District budget line of $300 per Health Center per month for a period of three years. Indonesia has over 10,000 Health Centers. Based on this success and work by WD’s new CEO in Indonesia, WD will sign an MOU on May 17 with APKASI, the Indonesian governors association to vend its product to Indonesia’s 153 Districts.</p>
<p>WD awaits a decision on the 2-year USAID petitioned grant to support Senegal's pre-eminent public hospitals, Diamniadio Children's Hospital and Fann Speciality Hospital in Dakar. Each of these public facilities has agreed to pay a $30K annual maintenance fee following successful implementation of WDs quality engineered electronic health record (EHR). Both institutions, despite caring for hundreds of thousands of patients a year, still use paper medical records.</p>
<p>WD is currently working with Alight on three grants to provide its services at Alight supported health facilities in Somalia and Ethiopia. Together, WD and Alight submitted a Google grant to support AI driven epidemic surveillance using data largely drawn from WD supported health care facilities.</p>
<p>This month, WD released a self-signup version of its EHR in Indonesia, where for a subscription fee, users can establish health facilities and invite staff to join with specified clinical permissions. This process can be seen here: <a href=""http://www.walkingdocs.com/"">www.walkingdocs.com</a>. We expect at least 10 new subscriptions our first month, then a month-over-month 100% increase in users, as use of an EHR for outpatient clinics is now law with compliance urged by the end of 2023. There are 60,000 clinics in Indonesia with less than 10% currently online.

The solution proposed is a comprehensive, cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) system designed with off-line functionality to ensure accessibility in remote or internet-challenged areas. This EHR system incorporates evidence-based treatment protocols in multiple languages, integrates a library of over 200 disease and condition algorithms, real-time feedback mechanisms, pharmacy management modules, and capabilities for data and system integration. The technology is in the Growth stage, currently serving facilities in Indonesia, Liberia, and Senegal, and planning expansions into Somalia and Ethiopia, reaching an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 individuals by 2024.

WD’s EHR specifically targets underserved regions and populations, including clinics near Senegal's borders where health resources are scarce, and the insurgency in the Casamance region poses additional challenges. The proposed solution aims to serve two clinics in Senegal: the Sinthian Clinic and the Wassadou Clinic, engaging with these facilities to improve health outcomes significantly by enhancing healthcare delivery's quality and efficiency.

The team behind Walking Doctors is described as diverse, bringing together expertise across emergency and primary care, health system strengthening, software development, and data science. This multidisciplinary team includes pediatrician Dr. Wilson Wang, CEO of Walking Doctors, and various international healthcare experts contributing to the EHR's content development and implementation.

WD operates on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenue model, where healthcare facilities pay subscription fees for using the EHR. This model has proved viable, with WD sustaining subscriptions beyond pilot implementations and planning for substantial growth and expansion. Walking Doctors anticipates increasing its reach and impact by facilitating the adoption of its EHR system in more clinics and health centers in Senegal and LMICs, aiming to dramatically improve patient care, healthcare efficiency, and public health outcomes.

The solution aligns with multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and demonstrates a measured and data-driven approach towards achieving its impact goals. Walking Doctors utilizes advanced technology, including big data, GIS, and cloud storage, for data security and system reliability, ensuring that the EHR system is both powerful and protective of patient privacy."

70650,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,"An armed conflict has displaced over 400,000 persons (mainly women and children) to informal settlements with no health care services. This solution will provide a comprehensive package of health services through ECHO & telemedicine using a hospital hub & locally trained Community Health workers.","<p>The Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon are the two English-speaking regions of the ten regions in the country, with a population of almost five million inhabitants (20% of Cameroon's population). These regions have experienced an armed conflict since 2017 with over 4000 people killed, over 400,000 internally displaced and at least 80,000 externally displaced into neighbouring Nigeria. This has resulted in disruption and massive closure of health facilities, poor access to health services for the displaced rural populations, and health providers fleeing the conflict zone. The displaced population has moved into very remote informal settlements, which are considered safe from warring parties of the crisis. Unfortunately, in these informal settings, there are no basic amenities like housing, water, sanitation, health care services or schools. Access to these informal settlements is exceedingly difficult and there are no established economic activities for the displaced women to make a living and support their families. This displaced population is subject to poverty, lack, and poor health and this has significantly increased the morbidity and mortality rate of this population, especially maternal, infant and childhood mortalities from common preventable, infectious diseases and injuries. The displaced population is also living in a very fragile security situation because they are often involved in the crossfire and constant attacks by the warring parties, especially in their efforts to travel and seek basic healthcare in health facilities in neighbouring towns. With the increasing severity of the armed crisis and the progressive deterioration of health services for this displaced population, there is an urgent need to structure a solution to improve the health status of this population through preventive, health promotion, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services.</p>","<p>Following lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increasing evidence that quality health care can be provided to individuals, families and communities remotely through telehealth/telemedicine programs. Additionally, evidence from the Extension for Community Health Outcome (ECHO) project implemented by the University of New Mexico and the AIDS Educational Training Centers (AETC) in the NW of the USA, has shown that capacity can be transferred from more specialized complex health settings to very remote, resource-limited settings using Community Health workers (CHWs) to obtain high-quality health outcomes for the community.<br /></p>
<p>Based on both models (Telemedicine and ECHO), Hi4D plan to implement a telemedicine and ECHO solution, to provide continuous and good quality health care to over 250,000 displaced population in informal settings, resulting from the armed crisis in Cameroon, especially targeting women and children. This model will identify community health workers (CHWs) living within the displaced population, train, and mentor them through the ECHO model and use them to provide health promotion and preventive medical services to the population. Hi4D has an established partnership agreement with the ECHO project of the University of New Mexico.</p>
<p>In addition, the solution will also use a telemedicine model with the FHL Medical Center hub to provide specialized medical care to individuals and families in informal settings using the hub and spoke model. The CHWs will be guided to set up spoke sites in these informal settlements with basic telephone and mobile internet connection to link up with specialists' medical providers in the FHL hub to guide targeted individualized medical care to members of the displaced settlement. </p>","<p>The population that this solution will serve are a sizable proportion of the over 400,000 displaced people from the armed crisis who are now living in informal settlements. Specifically, women and children in this population will be targeted for preventive and curative medical services. This population is currently living in extremely poor hygienic conditions with congestion and poor sewage disposal, no portable water supply, poor environmental conditions, and no economic activities to improve their nutrition and environmental conditions. They are exposed to both environmental and nutritional predictors of poor health and injuries. This solution will seek to reduce their environmental exposure through health promotion, health education and prevention intervention through the Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) model. Prevention of disease interventions like proper waste disposal, treatment of water, immunization for children, malaria prevention with insecticide-treated nets, condom distribution and antenatal care for pregnant women will be capital in this solution through health education and working with the local Department of Health to supply basic commodities. Prevention will also focus on screening for TB, and multi-disease screening for chronic conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and HIV, using trained and mentored community health workers. Key community stakeholders (traditional healers, and community leaders) will be engaged in these health promotion and prevention activities.<br />For persons in this population who are already suffering from any disease condition, the telemedicine solution will help to provide diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these patients, using the FHL Medical Centre telemedicine unit as the hub and CHWs setting up and coordinating a satellite health post in the communities as spokes. Hi4D will help with the identification and setting up of satellite telehealth posts in five informal settlements hosting the most displaced populations.</p>
<p>The informal settlement will promote risky sexual behaviors and also favor sexual exploitation as a means of livelihood, this solution will also provide family planning education and services and support the implementation of contraceptive methods within this population to prevent unwanted pregnancies and ensure the birth spacing</p>

<p>The solution will provide curative, chronic care and rehabilitative healthcare services to 5,000 patients per year (25,000 patients in 5 years) through telemedicine.<br /></p>","<p>With these solutions proposed to provide comprehensive health care for the displaced population, HI4D and FHL Medical Centre already have constituted ECHO teams and the telemedicine Unite. While HI4D is a registered local not-for-profit organization operating in the regions, FHL Medical Center is an independent Medical Care centre affiliated which has a signed agreement with Hi4D and will provide curative health care to the displaced population at a very subsidized rate. FHL Medical Centre has a functional telemedicine unit that is ready to provide free consultations to the displaced population in Cameroon through the telemedicine program and subsidized specialist care for complicated cases.</p>
<p>This solution will be privileged to benefit from SOLVE's expertise in technical assistance and SOLVE's network to mobilize financial resources to support this initiative. SOLVE's technical expertise and its extensive network of partners will be important to provide evidence-based and innovative strategies to tailor the ECHO and telemedicine interventions to the specific needs of these displaced populations. SOLVE will also guide the implementation of this model based on its experience of a similar model elsewhere. SOLVE and its network will also support financial solutions for the training of CHWs, stipends of selected CHWs intermediaries and for setting up and running of community satellite ECHO and telemedicine post. Most importantly, this solution will depend on the experience and technical support of the connected SOLVER network/ teams with partners who can help advance our solutions</p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact)","No, Solve is the first network joined",,Other (please specify),<p>Our organization Hi4D is a registered premium member of Funds for NGOs and our grants team usually looks for opportunities of interest to our organization and fortunately came across this exciting opportunity by Solve.</p>,"<p>The Northwest(NW) and the Southwest (SW) regions of Cameroon, with a population of five million inhabitants (20% of Cameroon's population) have experienced an armed conflict since 2017 with over 4000 people killed, over 400,000 internally displaced and at least 80,000 externally displaced (</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2018-march-2019/crisis-worsens-cameroon"">https://www.un.org/africarenew...</a>).  This has resulted in the disruption of economic and health activities, closure of hospitals, fleeing of health providers from the crisis, and population displaced to informal settlements with no access to health services. The most affected populations are women and children because their families have been killed in the crisis or have joined the militia leaving them to flee to safe havens. These women have lost their source of livelihood, are forced to become head of the household, have no economic activities in these new settlements and have no basic amenities for health, water, and sanitation services. Consequently, they have engaged in trading sex or other illegal acts as a means of sustaining their families. </p>
<p>The government has no means of reaching these populations due to poor transport, and insecurity and no basic services are planned for these informal settlements. </p>
<p>With the insecurity/poor access, we plan to implement an ECHO and telemedicine solution to provide continuous and quality healthcare to the displaced population targeting women and children. This model will identify community health workers (CHWs) living within these settlements, train and use them to implement and monitor preventive, curative, chronic care and rehabilitative health services in five selected displaced communities hosting most of the internally displaced women and children. Hi4D has an affiliated FHL Medical Centre with a pool of general and specialist clinicians that provide holistic medical care in the SW region and has a fully developed and functional telemedicine unit. Leveraging the widespread mobile phone/ internet network access in the country, this technology will be exploited to implement the telemedicine solution. Community stakeholders (community leaders and religious leaders with decision-making authorities in the communities) will be used to sensitize and mobilize the population within these settlements. Trained CHWs will set up megaphones at community venues where public health specialists can broadcast health promotion messages. Meanwhile, clients identified within the settlement with specific disease conditions will be consulted and offered expert treatment using the telemedicine model by the clinical/specialist team. </p>
<p>The solution will coordinate with the local Health Departments for basic public health services (immunization, hygiene, water, and sanitation), provision of medical supplies, and essential medications through an established route using local bikers. Local and international developmental partners (UNICEF, World Food Program) will be contacted to provide basic supplies to these displaced populations.</p>
<p>Telemedicine had been proven to be highly effective in providing quality health care remotely and this approach became widespread during the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach is poorly developed in Cameroon, but FHL Medical Center has an established and functional telemedicine team that has completed the Fundamentals of Telemedicine Operations with the Harvard University Telemedicine Unit</p>
<p>Hi4D has a partnership agreement with the University of New Mexico ECHO project.</p>","<p>Hi4D in collaboration with local stakeholders and the local department of health will map out the most populated informal settlements housing the most population (especially women and children), and informal settlements hosting more than 30,000 population will be targeted.</p>
<p> Community stakeholders (community leaders and religious leaders) with decision-making authorities in the communities will be used to sensitize and mobilize the population within these settlements and link them through ECHO for the provision of health education, health promotion and preventive messages by a team of public health experts. Identified and trained CHWs will be used to set up megaphones at community venues where the mobilized population will gather for the broadcast of health messages. This activity will target to reach out to 50,000 displaced population with quality preventive, health promotion, and health education messages per year. This activity will reach about 250,000 individuals in 5 years.</p>
<p>The FHL medical Center telemedicine team will train the identified 10 CHWs in each of the targeted communities (a total of 50 trained CHWs)  on telemedicine fundamentals and an additional 100 community stakeholders on primary healthcare approaches. These CHWs will select a health post within the informal settings (church or a tent) where basic and confidential medical consultation could take place and work with FHL to set up the basic telemedicine equipment (smart TV, Video conferencing and audio outlets, internet and mobile telephone set up). These satellite posts will be linked to the FHL telemedicine unit where the specialist will connect for individual confidential patient consultation and offer a line of management. The CHWs will be mentored on patient nursing and improvement follow-up according to an agreed management plan by the clinician. The clinical team will connect with the remote sites regularly to monitor the clinical improvement of the clients. The solution will provide curative, chronic care and rehabilitative healthcare services to 5000 patients per year (25,000 patients in 5 years) through telemedicine.</p>
<p>Local stakeholders and local transporters, especially bikers who have understood the dynamics of the crisis and can navigate their way to towns and to these displaced settlements will be engaged to set up a channel to facilitate the transport of essential medicines and medical supplies.<br />The local Ministry of health department will be engaged to facilitate the delivery of vaccines, essential medications (antimalarials, antiparasitic and antibiotics) and medical supplies. Local and international development partners will be engaged in the delivery of food and medical supplies. </p>
<p>Lessons learnt from this telehealth solution (which is still very poorly developed in Cameroon), will be shared with local and national stakeholders, and can set the pace for the MOH to serve the remote and inaccessible communities in Cameroon, even in the other 8 regions that do not have an armed crisis, considering that 60% of the country is rural and inaccessible in many aspects. This will also provide evidence for the development of telemedicine in the country.</p>",3. Good Health and Well-being,"<p>The project will collect routine hospital and public health data for service offices to patients and displaced populations in the informal settlement through telemedicine and ECHO services. Standard clinical registers and Primary health care data collection tools from the local department of health (hospital and community outreach tools) will be used. The indicators of interest collected in routine tools will be customized into a data software called DAMA. DAMA is an electronic version of hospital data found in hospital registers, which will integrate community indicators which will be used to aggregate and summarize the data for specific indicators for reporting to stakeholders. The indicators of importance in this solution address SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being at all ages for the displaced population in Cameroon due to the armed conflict. </p>

This target population primarily consists of women and children who now reside in informal settlements without basic amenities, including healthcare services. The initiative plans to deploy a combined approach utilizing the Extension for Community Health Outcome (ECHO) model and telemedicine to deliver comprehensive health services. This approach leverages the partnership with the ECHO project of the University of New Mexico and the FHL Medical Center hub for telemedicine services. 

Community Health Workers (CHWs), who are part of the displaced populations, will be trained and mentored to provide health promotion, preventive medical services, and act as intermediaries for specialized medical care via telemedicine. The solution sets to reach 50,000 displaced individuals annually with preventive and educational health services and aims to provide curative, chronic, and rehabilitative services to 5,000 patients per year through telemedicine, totaling 25,000 patients in five years.

The solution's impact targets align with several UN Sustainable Development Goals, mainly focusing on Good Health and Well-being. Progress will be measured using routine data collection tools integrated into a software system for tracking various health indicators, such as maternal and under-5 mortality rates, disease prevention, and access to healthcare services.

The project is at the Pilot stage, proposing to test the model with a small group of users in five selected informal settlements hosting significant populations of internally displaced persons.

It addresses the widespread issue of anemia, which affects nearly 1 in 4 people globally, by offering a cost-effective and accessible solution especially beneficial in regions with limited healthcare resources. The model operates under the hypothesis that conjunctival pallor, visible through a thin layer of conjunctiva in the eye, correlates with hemoglobin concentration levels, allowing for non-invasive anemia detection.

The solution targets a broad audience, including telehealth patients, underserved populations in remote areas, individuals with chronic diseases, and those undergoing cancer screening. The development team is led by Dr. Ritchie Verma, a specialist in Internal Medicine with a background in clinical informatics and AI in medicine, alongside a diverse team comprising experts in hematology/oncology, internal medicine, AI/ML, and data management. The team's association with renowned institutions like MGH and Cleveland Clinic provides a robust foundation for the project's success.

The proposal specifies this solution as being in the 'Prototype' stage. This is evidenced by the ongoing pilot study and data collection at MGH, collaborations with Cleveland Clinic and planned international data collection efforts, highlighting a transition from concept to concrete development. The solution aims to integrate easily into telehealth platforms and offers a significant improvement in convenience and accessibility over traditional blood draw methods.

The solution seeks financial support for further development and testing, emphasizing the need for expanding data collection efforts, computing resources, and prototype testing in various settings, including the potential inclusion of a pediatric population. The proposal includes plans for financial sustainability through a multi-stream revenue model focusing on subscription services, licensing, in-app purchases, partnerships, grants, and investment capital.

This AI-based approach to anemia detection and monitoring is presented as a user-friendly, non-invasive alternative that promises to reduce healthcare costs, improve patient comfort, and enhance access to care through the widespread availability of smartphones. The team measures its progress through a combination of user adoption rates, geographic reach, reduction in blood draws, and alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals, reflecting a comprehensive plan for addressing a critical global health issue."
71056,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,A network of trusted health specialists located anywhere in the world connected to our local fixed or mobile medical centers/laboratories partners or patient gadget via a mobile platform to provide access of quality care at low cost to anyone even in destabilizing events.,"<p>First we have to define what is a destabilizing event. Destabilizing event mean some events that cause a loss of equilibrium as a conflict, displacement or natural disasters. For certain societies where access to health care is difficult, these destabilizing event cause problem in the availability , accessibility and quality of health services.</p>
<p>The specific problem within the challenge that we are working to solve is to have access to health care even when the community is facing armed conflict. Because of armed conflict, people are more exposed to fragile context with higher risk to death. That include that people can not have primary care when needed because of local capacity issue. That also means that people can not have a quality of health service because of insecurity.</p>
<p>For example those armed conflict can be leaded by armed gang. In the community that we are working in, the percentage of armed gang is about 75% which cause a huge issue that prevent people to access properly to health care when needed. The whole population of a country can be affected by this problem. The right to health being part of the fundamental right, everyone should have an efficient health system and a way to receive help when needed. This is the reason why the team leader and the team thought about a solution to improve local capacity and build resilience in health system.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>Our solution provides a low-cost, secure and mobile platform matching patients with our network of trusted health specialists located anywhere in the world and local fixed or mobile medical centers/laboratories to provide access to quality care even in destabilizing situations. </p>
<p>It allows patients suffering a specific health problem (ex: headache, bellyache, etc) to quickly connect in a matter of seconds with one or more of our trusted remote physicians located anywhere in the world and who is/are well-suited to assist them for this specific health problem. The platform can match remote physicians working on a specific patient case with other  remote physicians located anywhere in the world. If the physician asks for the app, this makes our platform even more powerful.</p>
<p>The way it works is very simple:  The client uses his/her smartphone or any other small phone in case there is no access to internet connectivity and tells our system what he/she feels. Our platform thus connects them to one of our remote trusted health specialists for assistance. </p>
<p>There are two scenarios: </p>
<p>1) The problem does not require any physical intervention. In this case, the remote physician tells the patient which medication to take and might plan the next online appointment with the client for followup. </p>
<p>2) The online communication is not enough so that the physician can diagnose the patient, he asks him to make a  laboratory test or he wants to have access to his/her vital signs. In this case, the mobile app using GPS technology, guides the patient to one of our well-suited local laboratory partners/medical centers partners or in some very destabilizing situations, asks them to use our gadget which can take the patient's vital sign and assign this information to the patient document on the system so that the remote health specialist can access it and uses this information to provide a medication prescription and plan next appointment for other follow up. </p>
<p>Several remote health specialists can collaborate on a single patient case via the platform if there is need for that. Also, our mobile platform allows remote health specialists to collaborate with local generalist physicians working in local partnered health centers in order to better provide care to a patient on a specific health problem.
</p>
<p>In some cases, clients might feel uncomfortable to identify themselves. In situation, during online meetings on the platform between patients and remote health specialists, clients might have the choice to identify themselves or not. 
</p>
<p>Also, in order to make our platform a trusted place for patients, we define a safe strategy for health specialists to join the platform. They will be validated by a hospital or a university and sign a legal document engaging them to be accountable legally for the service they are provided on the system.</p>","<p>The target populations that interest us are those where people live in difficult situations because of destabilizing events that can put them in fragile contexts. Particularly people who live in countries where the government cannot respond effectively and efficiently to the  needs of the population. Therefore we are working to bring a significant change in the lives of these people. <br /></p>
<p>The health system being one of those that requires more logistics, staff and equipments, it becomes unavoidable that the governments of low-income countries where there can be violence, armed conflicts, poverty cannot not meet the healthcare needs of our target population.</p>
<p>In addition, because of these difficult contexts, the population is on its own, moving to a hospital can be difficult, so it is the wealthiest people who will have the means and access to health care.</p>
<p>What we offer with this solution is unlimited access to healthcare personnel at any time at any time. It will therefore meet their needs in an effective way because There will therefore be available to Our target population Specialists from all over the world ready to serve them and advise them on any of the diseases as real on our platform. In addition, thanks to this solution, anyone with a smartphone will be able to communicate, exchange with health personnel without having to move from one city to another.</p>","<p>Several reasons make us the right people to design and deliver this solution to the target population, but the biggest is the proximity we have to the target population that we serve this solution.</p>
<p>As said before, the target population to which we propose this solution is the one whose government cannot adequately meet their health needs while the population is facing destabilizing events such as armed conflicts or who have experienced destabilizing events in the past. As a natural disaster and the people are still dealing with the repercussions. The first example of a country that lived and still lives in this situation is the country that the team currently live in, that is to say: Haiti.<br />The team leader and the team come from the Haitian community, we have experienced and knowledged the problems of access to health care because they are part of the daily lives of our loved ones. This is why as young Haitian leader we made a field observation to better understand the needs of our target population. When designing this solution, the team leader and the team also called on health specialists and asked their opinions on this subject.<br />Its design and implementation are guided by the demand to be able to discuss and have medical opinions online. Several people that the team has consulted about this project in Our target community have admitted to having probably thought of having a means like the one we are proposing but which can come to nothing because of a lack of resources and logistics.</p>
<p>The design of Hopimobil and its implementation in the real life of the Haitian population could be a turning point in the health system in Haiti. It could guarantee access to a mobile platform of health experts for all in real time</p>","Increase local capacity and resilience in health systems, including the health workforce, supply chains, and primary care services","our solution team is headquartered in Port au Prince, the capital of Haiti.",,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone","<p>Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood. A prototype is the representation of the concept. It focuses on the full functionality of all included features.</p>
<p>Our solution is rather a prototype because we have gone beyond the ideology of this solution, we have materialized it.</p>
<p>Hopimobil is an application that can be operational with the necessary funds and resources. It has been tested by developers and can be installed already on smartphones. Hopimobile works and we can already connect to the platform and register as a patient, present the symptoms of the illness. The platform then compiles a medical file and sends the request to a specialist who can later give his medical opinion.</p>
<p> Of course it remains a prototype because we still have a lot of work to complete so that our solution can achieve its full effectiveness and viability.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>Our solution being still in the prototype phase, it is not yet on the market and is not yet available on application stores such as Google play store or apple store. Therefore currently Hopimobil has not yet helped anyone in the health system but our team is working to make this dream a reality in order to resiliently solve problems with health access even in destabilizing events.</p>","<p>We are applying to solve for several reasons: </p>
<p>1) Financial reason: If selected to be a Solver team, the 10 000 USD we will receive will be useful. For now, I am the only mobile developer working on the prototype. This is why I can start developing the solution without expending any money. And because I use (Firebase powerful, scalable cloud-based back-end solution, and flutter as a multi-platform solution from Google, and based on my experience on developing and releasing mobile app on both play store and app store, I am able to develop the prototype on my own. So, my team can use the 10 000 USD to pay additional developers to work on the solution and we can pay also for cloud services with a part of it. </p>
<p>2) Support to help our solution go to production and be scaled : We saw that solver teams have access to mentorship, coaching, and strategic advice from experts, as well as the Solve and MIT networks. This will help us to advance our solution.</p>
<p>3) Inspiration : As mention on the ""become-a-solver"" page at the Solve website, solver teams join a class of impressive peers acting as trusted as trusted support, inspiration and guidance, we will enjoy being part of that teams to get inspired and have enough energy and motivation to make the solution a reality. When being among like minded-people try to solve challenges of our time, we are more motivated. </p>
<p>4) Trust of the brand: Even if our solution is efficient, people need to trust it. For that to happen, being showed in the media and at conferences will help a lot. People will trust a brand better when they see people are talking about it everywhere. Even people in my community, they will have a higher image of the solution if they see people are globally talking about it. They will have a kind of pride. </p>","Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Human Capital (e.g. sourcing talent, board development), Product / Service Distribution (e.g. delivery, logistics, expanding client base), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)","No, Solve is the first network joined",,Email from Solve,<p>Via email notifications from Solve. </p>,,,3.

The solution is a mobile platform that connects patients with health specialists located anywhere in the world and local medical centers or laboratories. Through this platform, individuals facing barriers to healthcare due to unstable conditions can receive medical guidance and prescriptions. The platform operates through a simple interface that allows patients to describe their symptoms and be paired with a remote physician suitable for their specific health problems. Patients can receive consultations and, if necessary, directions for further tests or vital sign monitoring through partnered facilities or a specialized gadget.

The solution targets individuals in countries where governments cannot sufficiently meet health service needs, especially in the context of conflict or poverty. It aims to provide a resilient mechanism for access to quality healthcare, leveraging the global availability of health specialists and local medical infrastructure.

The solution is at the prototype stage, indicating that a functional version of the platform has been developed and tested, albeit not yet deployed in real-world conditions. The platform is operational in a testing environment, allowing patient registration, symptom reporting, and remote consultations. However, it has not served any users outside the development setting.

The team behind this solution is based in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, highlighting a deep personal and contextual understanding of the challenges faced by the target population. The team possesses the requisite skills in mobile development and has engaged with health specialists and community members in designing the solution.

In seeking support through the Solve initiative, the proposal outlines the need for financial resources, mentorship, and public relations assistance to transition the prototype to a fully operational service. The funding and support sought are intended to accelerate development, enhance the platform's capabilities, and scale the solution to reach the target population effectively.

The solution's innovative approach lies in its ability to bridge geographical and infrastructural gaps in healthcare access through technology, specifically tailored to the needs of populations in fragile contexts. While the proposal does not detail impact goals, the overarching objective is clear: to provide an effective healthcare access platform that can function amid the complexities of destabilizing events."
71174,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Semi-Finalist,"HealthOpX digitizes processes for food/diaper banks, religious and ethnic organizations to effectively partner with healthcare organizations to improve access to care for overlapping uninsured and Medicaid/Medicare populations.","<p>HealthOpX is addressing two points of the MIT Solve challenge
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<ul><li>Enable informed interventions, and decision-making by governments, local health systems, and aid groups by providing social determinants of health data and service history from our community organization partners
  </li></ul><ul><li>The partnerships we create between the community organizations and healthcare organizations are in low-income underserved communities, and our electronic referral platform improves accessibility and quality of health services for those communities.
   
   
  </li></ul><p>In addition, as a diverse company that is co-founded and owned by a 2nd generation Asian American, 2nd generation Latinx American, and black-American, we currently work with refugee organizations, food banks, diaper banks, churches, and other organizations across the U.S. that impact similar communities that our families grew up in. 
  </p>","<p>HealthOpX has built an in-house nonprofit CRM called HelpOpX that digitizes processes and member data for community organizations such as diaper banks, food banks, religious organizations, and ethnic organizations. This new and flexible technology specializes on low-tech nonprofits that have large amounts of data and service underserved communities that are uninsured or on Medicaid/Medicare. 
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>Our nonprofit CRM has a custom plug-in that we built that allows community organizations to send electronic referrals to federally qualified health centers, case workers, and other relevant groups. This referral can send over survey data, social determinants of health data, notes on what the person needs, and nonprofit services the community member has received in the past so that healthcare professionals can accurately assess the needs of the patient. Community members can also scan a questionnaire QR code at the nonprofit site, or have it scanned for them if they do not have a smart phone and be automatically referred to different organizations on our network based on their needs. This could be for transportation needs, medical needs, housing needs, enrolling in food assistance programs, etc. This transforms the community organizations into a familiar access point of care for community members.
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>Blending in individualized social determinants of health data and healthcare data as a healthcare organization or government organization allows them to make more informed decisions with interventions. It is also more useful than population health level data because outreach can be conducted at the individual level. 
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>Bridging the technology gap for community organizations enables a natural partnership between community organizations, government organizations, and healthcare organizations to better serve their overlapping underserved communities and removes barriers to access care for those communities. 
  </p>","<p>The population we work with are people in the U.S. on Medicaid/Medicare, uninsured, or living below or around the ALICE threshold. The ALICE threshold is the minimum income level necessary for survival for a threshold. Specifically, the people that receive services or attend food banks, diaper banks, religious organizations, ethnic organizations, and community outreach organizations. One of the organizations we work with gives an example of the health needs of this population: the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama stated that 70% of those surveyed had high blood pressure which leads to stroke and heart disease. 37% of those surveyed have diabetes. 
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>There are rampant, correlative health issues related to poverty and social determinants of health. On average, a person will go to the food bank 7 times a year. We see that as 7 times that we could work with healthcare organizations to identify and address healthcare issues, create individualized treatment plans, or deliver preventative care resources catered to that individual. By providing these services, we are able to overcome barriers to transportation, access to care, and knowledge gaps for community members.
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>The easiest way to engage the population we are targeting is to show up at places where they are already asking for help and work with entities that they trust. By providing newly digitized data from community organizations to government and healthcare organizations, not only will there be the opportunity for positive healthcare outcomes, there will be opportunities for structural and policy change from the government.

We are currently onboarding the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama that has 330 food pantries and collectively serves around ~40,000 people a year. We have an upcoming paid pilot with the University of Alabama-Birmingham Health System, which is the in the top 10 largest health systems in the U.S., and Cooper Green (federally qualified health center) to improve access to care for individuals in Birmingham, Alabama.<br /></p>

<p>To provide some background on some of the barriers we face, Alabama is a very conservative state, and is not a Medicaid expansion state. Meaning, even though we seek to benefit the uninsured population there few monetary incentives outside of working with health systems and Medicaid/Medicare payers (health insurers). Although we were able to secure a paid pilot with a health system, the payers are very risk averse. Even if we can prove that we can get people to primary care physicians, case workers, and social assistance organizations, the payers need data that ties our services into outcomes, which typically takes a year or longer. This is a barrier we will run into in many states. </p>

These organizations are often the largest holders of up to date contact information, service information, and social determinants of health data for underserved communities. This newly digitized and structured data is extremely valuable for healthcare organizations, government organizations, and innovators to address needs and complete data sets at an individual level. Making it so that community organizations can easily work with these broader organizations without needing to be tech experts opens the door for collaboration that would positively impact underserved communities. Making community organization collaboration more accessible from a process, data, and security standpoint would break down barriers and catalyze more ideas and solutions targeting underserved communities.

<p>On our platform we can track completed referrals to case workers and county governments when trying to determine how many people we were able to get re-enrolled onto Medicaid after Medicaid Re-Determination. Since people are not always accepted onto Medicaid after applying, we will have to check every quarter to reassess the referral to enrolled ratio.

This partnership seeks to improve access to healthcare for uninsured and Medicaid/Medicare populations in the United States, with a specific focus on low-income, underserved communities. By leveraging an in-house developed nonprofit CRM named HelpOpX, the solution digitizes community organizations' processes and member data. This platform ensures that valuable social determinants of health data and service history are easily transferable to healthcare providers, improving informed interventions and decision-making capabilities.

The HealthOpX solution is currently at the Pilot stage. It is testing its product, service, or business model with a small number of users across Michigan and Alabama, impacting approximately 37,000 community members directly through various partnerships with community outreach organizations, Diaper Banks, the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama, and a health system pilot with the University of Alabama-Birmingham Health System among others.

HealthOpX directly addresses the challenge of improving the accessibility and quality of health services for underserved groups in fragile contexts by creating a technological solution that enables community organizations to work efficiently with healthcare providers. The platform facilitates the sharing of critical health and social determinants of health data through electronic referrals and questionnaires, thus becoming a vital tool in coordinating care and support for vulnerable populations.

The team behind HealthOpX consists of diverse co-founders with personal experiences of the challenges faced by their target communities, which drives their commitment to creating a solution that addresses health inequity through technology and partnerships. Their approach emphasizes diversity, equity, and inclusivity, with plans to expand their services across more states within the United States.

HealthOpX's revenue model involves charging a sliding scale fee to community organizations for using their CRM tool, and fees to healthcare systems and insurers for referrals and care coordination services. The team also pursues government grants and has received investments and grants from various sources, demonstrating a layered approach to achieving financial sustainability. 

Their solution's innovation lies in transforming the capability of low-tech community organizations to engage in digital collaboration with health and government organizations, thus facilitating better health outcomes for at-risk communities through coordinated care and individualized health interventions."
71305,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,Holistic approach to health in fragile contexts,"<p>Many people in Malawi and globally  are enormously bombarded by health problems in fragile contexts and destabilising events as explained below :</p>
<p>During emergencies, international bodies like African Public Health Emergency Fund for Africa fail to adequately support affected countries because of limited financial resources due to non-contribution by member states. One reason member states fail to contribute is the absence of the mechanism for authorities at  ministries of health or finance to know if contribution to APHEF is done as planned.<br /></p>

<p> It uses BarEl software, which we developed. It has a number of modules; including, a module for health. It uses database management and Excel.<br /></p>
<p>In order that governments in Africa honour their contributions to APHEF, budgets for ministries of health in Africa should have budget lines for APHEF so that tracking of their contributions should be done easily through expenditure reports. BarEl software has a budget line for APHEF; and through its expenditure analysis tool and its alert system, authorities at ministries of health and finance can take necessary action in the event of underexpenditure of APHEF budget line.</p>
<p>Our solution has a budget line for emergencies.<br /></p>
<p>It gives frontline health workers tools they need to  capture all health indicators like mortality rates, prevalence  and incidence of diseases.<br /></p>
<p>It  improves  transport management at a health facility by: </p>
<p>1. improving maintenance of vehicles.<br /></p>
<p>2. reducing or eliminating abuse of vehicles or fuel by drivers and other staff members.</p>
<p>BarEl software plays a pivotal role in nutrition Management; for example, by calculating calories lost, Body Mass Index  and Basal Metabolic Rate;hence, reduction in malnutrition and non-communicable diseases like Hypertension and Diabetes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the aid of BarEl software, the following are realised:<br /></p>
<p>Pilferage and shortage of drugs are eradicated or reduced through stock management methods like FIFO and LIFO.<br /></p>
<p>Delays in procuring drugs, stock-outs and cost of procuring drugs are reduced through Economic Order Quantity, improved procurement management, inventory management and different forecasting methods  like seasonal index, historical, exponential smoothing and moving averages.</p>
<p>Human resource management is immensely improved through  appraisal system, human resource planning, leave application process and preparing staff returns. Performance rating system facilitates retention of health workers. The staff return and leave application prevents shortage or overage of staff at any point in time.</p>
<p>Improved water management by ensuring provision of quality and enough water; thereby, reducing waterborne diseases. Furthermore, conflicts that arise because of water issues, among community members are reduced because each household  pays water bills and maintenance costs according to how much they consume. <br /></p>
<p>Water crises  are mitigated by construction of a water storage tank near a water point, so that at no point will taps or water points run dry due to excessive withdrawals.</p>
<p>Improved sanitation, waste management; and monitoring of toilet or latrine management.<br /></p>
<p>BarEl software has easy to use statistical package for health research.</p>
<p>It aids in management of immunisation campaigns, quality management, and project management.</p>

Though BarEl software is based on Microsoft Access, it can be upgraded to Express Edition, which has a bigger capacity to store information. It can also be upgraded to SQL Microsoft Azure, which can enable it to reach many users worldwide through cloud services.</p>",A new application of an existing technology,,"Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, Big Data, Software and Mobile Applications",Malawi,Zambia,Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit,,"Four people work on the solution team. These are: Thumbiko Shumba, the CEO & Founder;  Tiwonge Kuyokwa, the Data Analyst; Mwayi Mbewe, the Data Analyst; and Humphreys Mphatso Simfukwe, the IT Coordinator.

He retired as Deputy Director of Finance in the Malawi Government. We are all full-time staff.",We have been working on our solution for four years.,"<p>Our approach to incorporating diversity, equity, and inclusivity into our work is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Employ people of different backgrounds. It is our policy to have the following as our employees: women, youths, persons with disabilities, ethnic minorities, people from different  racial or tribal backgrounds, people from different homes of origin, people of different religious and economic status. In fact, we have two women in our solution team; namely, Tiwonge Kuyokwa and Mwayi Mbewe. They are both Data Analysts.</p>
<p>2. Help employees to understand how individuals are impacted by unconscious bias, and what actions continue to reinforce biases. We encourage every employee to review, question, and analyze their own personal biases and assumptions.</p>
<p>3.  Respect and embrace other people's experiences and realities. Cultural humility is another way leaders and employees can manage bias and foster more inclusive environments.</p>
<p>4. Identify patterns or trends that may exist where certain groups of employees are underpaid within certain areas of the business; and observe equal pay for equal work.</p>
<p>5. Conduct diversity training that helps employees understand how cultural differences can impact how people work and interact at work. It can cover anything from concepts of time and communication styles to self-identity and dealing with conflict.</p>
<p>6. Promote awareness of, and acknowledge a variety of upcoming religious and cultural holidays. </p>
<p>7. Make it easy for our colleagues at work to participate in employee resource groups.</p>
<p>8. Ensure that people of different gender, cultural background or age are working together. Diversity in teams positively impacts creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>9. Encourage our colleagues at work to share their feedback to get a better understanding of what is going on under the surface.</p>
<p>10.Assess areas of the business in which discrimination can exist. Determine whether policies promote discrimination in the workplace such as racism or sexism; and then take corrective measures to move towards a more equitable workplace. </p>
<p>11. Believe in equity and justice.</p>
<p>12.Ensure that our leadership team is diverse by promoting women, people with disabilities, youths and ethnic minorities into leadership positions.</p>

  </p>",Government (B2G),"<p>Our plans for becoming financially sustainable are :</p>
<p>.selling our digital product BarEl software as a service sold per unit. Our customers can access our product through subscription. It is a licensed software. We offer freemiums to our potential customers. It is on Face Book marketplace.We aspire that it should be on other marketplaces like MIT Solve.</p>
<p>. charging a small fee for installation, maintenance, consultancy and training. We are also looking forward for grants or donations from MIT Solve or philanthropists or investors so that we scale our activities.</p>
<p>. charging different prices to different customers. Price discrimination will depend on size, location and type of customer.  Low income earners will be charged low prices. Government and corporate customers will be charged more than individual customers. Prices will also be charged on SaaS. The more features of BarEl software a customer acquires, the higher the price. We will  charge per year  $5 to individual customers with low income and $50 to corporate customers with no or low profits, and $1000 to governments or big corporate customers that are financially able. We will charge maintenance and installation fees.</p>
<p>. ensuring input efficiency by conducting trainings  en-masse and at once; hence,  reducing training cost per unit, resulting in  higher profit margins. </p>
<p>. scaling through:</p>
<p>a. vertical scaling. We will create partnerships .We will improve our product for small customers before targeting larger customers. We want to build relationships with more global brands to enable larger sales orders. And we will agree on how to share profits .  BarEl software is  multipurpose.</p>
<p>b. horizontal scaling : we will expand our offering to customers in neighbouring countries, then the Sub-Saharan Africa; and then, the whole world.  African market is largely untapped,and BarEl software is currently one of the few players in the space.</p>
<p>In addition, our revenue models that we will or we employ separately or as a combination:</p>
<p><strong>Hiring or Employment, </strong><strong>One-for-one model also known as buy-one give-one, </strong><strong>Service subsidization,</strong> A<strong>wareness &amp; Cause, </strong><strong>Environmental, </strong><strong>Entrepreneur support, </strong><strong>Organizational support, </strong><strong>Low-income client  and </strong><strong>Fee-for-service .</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transaction revenue</strong>: One-time sale of BarEl software or our services. </p>

This software solution intends to address a range of systemic health service challenges exacerbated by emergencies and underfunding. It specifically targets the African Public Health Emergency Fund (APHEF) contribution issue by creating a budget line that enables ministries of health in Africa to track their contributions efficiently. Furthermore, it promotes improved health system infrastructure through accurate, actionable health-related data and governance enhancements.

The proposal outlines how the software will directly contribute to various health system components, including workforce capacity building, supply chain management, and primary care services improvement. It incorporates modules to manage health indicators, improve transport for healthcare access, manage nutrition, and secure drug supplies through better stock management. Additionally, the software offers capabilities for human resource management, water management, and sanitation improvements. The development stage of the product is classified as Pilot, indicating that the team is testing the product with a small user base through their client, EMD Consulting Engineers, affecting hundreds of people.

The solution targets a broad spectrum of individuals, including women, children, ethnic minorities, and marginalized groups, addressing barriers to healthcare access, quality of service, and environmental health factors contributing to disease prevalence. The team is composed of individuals with direct experiences and connections to the healthcare sector in Malawi, including professionals with backgrounds in business administration, data analysis, and health.

To expand their reach and achieve their impact goals, the team seeks financial assistance, strategic advice, and technological support to scale their solution. They aim to address a wide range of UN Sustainable Development Goals, including Good Health and Well-being, Clean Water and Sanitation, and Reduced Inequalities, among others.

The business model outlined suggests a blend of direct sales of the software, training services, and prospective funding through grants and donations. The solution is touted as innovative due to its comprehensive approach to addressing health system challenges in fragile contexts through a multi-functional software platform.

The team's financial sustainability plans involve scaling the solution through vertical and horizontal strategies, partnership development, and adopting a flexible pricing model to accommodate a diverse client base, aiming at a significant market potential in Malawi and beyond. Successes so far include the formation of valuable partnerships and initial revenue generation through consulting and training services using the BarEl software."
71335,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,Taping into the knowledge and skills of people who have lived experience to guide change in the mental health sector,"<p>Our world is reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, wars, displacement, and the climate emergency, all of which have consequences for the well-being of world citizens. The rates of people experiencing suicidal ideation are increasing globally, and about one in eight people live with a mental disorder; it is the leading cause of years lived with disability (YLDs), accounting for one in every six YLDs globally, according to WHO. 75% to 95% of people with mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries cannot access mental health services at all, and governments spend, on average, just over 2% of their health budgets on mental health, resulting in a treatment gap of 80%. In addition Mental health disorders account for 13% of the global burden of disease, and this figure will rise to nearly15% by 2030 according to WHO </p>
<p>The Ministry of Health estimates that 25% of Kenyans have a mental health issue at any given time. However, according to a WHO 2017 report, the Kenyan government spends only 0.01% of its total health expenditure on mental health. As a result of this treatment gap, WHO estimates that 80% of those affected do not receive the professional assistance they need. </p>
<p>Generally, people with mental health illnesses are highlighted as a vulnerable group subject to stigma and social isolation, human rights violations, and exclusion from policies and decision-making that affect them (WHO, 2010). In many places, formal mental health services do not exist; Even when they are available, they are often inaccessible or unaffordable, and too often, they are subjected to human rights abuses by some of the very health services responsible for their care. As a result, people will often choose to endure mental distress without treatment rather than risk facing prejudice and ostracization that comes with accessing mental health services. This problem worsens medically underserved populations and impoverished and marginalized communities.
</p>
<p>For decades, the design and implementation of mental health services and interventions has been done without the input of those who use and require the services. For the few that have, people with lived experience are not included at the decision-making table. This has resulted in mental health services and interventions that do not address the specific needs of people experiencing  mental health illnesses, negatively impacting them. </p>","<p>Our solution taps into Lived Experience Experts ( a person who has a personal experience with a mental illness or a caregiver who has intimate experience in supporting a person living with a mental condition).These experts have special person-centered knowledge gained from first-hand experience with a mental condition which is often missed within the mental health field and have essential skills and knowledge beyond just the experience of a mental condition and recovery. It encompasses an understanding of marginalization, oppression, and discrimination. </p>
<p>This Experts provides this knowledge and skills through mental health trainings. Where the lived experience experts are the lead trainers supported by experts by training. This trainings are done virtually taking advantage of the development of online platforms such as zoom, google meet, etc. during the pandemic that has enabled us to do so much virtually.</p>
<p>It incorporates storytelling, as stories have the power to elicit emotional responses, put a face to an issue, connect us to deeper issues, and humanize us, resulting in inspiration, teaching, clarification, and mobilization. The Experts share their lived experiences as practical examples. </p>
<p>The Experts use the platform as well to provide psychoeducation services ( <strong>the process of providing education and information to those seeking or receiving mental health services) </strong></p>
<p>Lastly, provision of psychosocial support services:</p>
<ol><li>Support groups. Run by trained peers and focus on emotional support, sharing experiences, education and practical activities</li><li>one-to-one support .meeting trained peer to talk about how you’re feeling or to set goals.</li></ol><p><br /></p>

<p>Most Africans view mental health illness as a result of an external attack on the person. Those experiencing  mental health illnesses are thought to be under a spell or bewitched, and as a result, they face stigma and social isolation, human rights violations, and exclusion from policies and decision-making that affect them, limiting their participation in all aspects of society, including social, economic, and political aspects. In addition to the lack of mental health services as a result many choose to suffer in silence rather than face the stigma and discrimination that comes with mental health illness. This problem is exuberated for those living in low income settings and those in rural areas.</p>
<p>It expands coverage and access to mental health services and information ( mental health training, psychoeducation services, and psychosocial services). Reduce the cost of access to services and information for beneficiaries because all other services are free excepted the mental health training services which are costed 50-60% below the market rate; the only cost is internet data.</p>

The solution leverages the expertise of Lived Experience Experts—individuals who have personally encountered mental health issues or cared for someone who has—to lead mental health training, supported by professionals in the field. These training sessions are conducted virtually, utilizing online platforms like Zoom and Google Meet, which have gained popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. The program includes storytelling as a key component to facilitate emotional connection, education, and inspiration. Additionally, it offers psychoeducation and psychosocial support services, including support groups and one-to-one consultations, all aimed at young people aged 15 to 35 in Nakuru, Kenya.

The proposal identifies a critical problem: the global and local rise in mental health disorders juxtaposed against the inadequacy of mental health services, exacerbated by stigma and a lack of inclusive policy-making. Specifically, it notes that in Kenya, despite a high prevalence of mental health issues, there is minimal government expenditure on mental health, leading to a significant treatment gap. The solution seeks to mitigate these issues by enhancing the availability, accessibility, and quality of mental health services, aiming to empower individuals living with mental health conditions socially, economically, and politically. The approach is innovative in its centering of lived experience in the design and delivery of mental health interventions, aiming to ensure these services are relevant, culturally sensitive, and effective.

The team, comprising young individuals with lived experience in mental health, is executing the solution in the pilot stage. It is demonstrated by their initial engagement of 672 young people at risk of or living with mental health conditions. The team's intimate understanding of the beneficiaries' context and needs, given their personal experiences and demographic alignment, is a crucial strength of this proposal.

To scale their impact, the team seeks mentorship along with both non-monetary and monetary support to enhance their organizational systems, including accounting, monitoring and evaluation, human resource management, marketing, and refining scaling strategies. Their business model relies on providing subsidized mental health services, funded through donations, fundraising, and the revenue generated from their consultancy services.

The proposal delineates a theory of change that includes delivering mental health trainings, psychoeducation, psychosocial support, and advocacy, leading to short-term outcomes such as improved mental health knowledge and social support systems. The long-term goal encompasses enhanced quality of life, social participation, and stigma reduction for individuals with mental health conditions. They measure progress through the number of people trained, the extent of community awareness, and the personal development of individuals engaging with their services.

Regarding inclusivity, the organization emphasizes diversity in its team composition and activities, ensuring representation of individuals from various backgrounds, including those with psychosocial disabilities, women, young people, and different ethnicities. The business model and plan for financial sustainability involve pursuing a mix of donations, grants, and revenue from their subsidized services, with an aim toward broadening their funding base to ensure long-term viability."
71724,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Semi-Finalist,"Grace Health is the leading women’s health platform in emerging markets with over 1.3 million users in Sub Saharan Africa, providing radical accessibility to affordable healthcare.","<p>There are 1.2B women in low and middle-income countries with access to a mobile phone, however, despite this, 48% of Africa’s population lack access to adequate care. Grace Health is committed to addressing the problem of inadequate access to women's health information and services in emerging markets. This problem is caused by several factors, including the high cost of healthcare, limited distribution of healthcare professionals, and societal stigma surrounding women's health. A sentiment to the lack of available healthcare can be seen in the fact that according to the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics, the average Nigerian will pay 10% of their yearly income on one single hospital visit. Moreover, healthcare is heavily inaccessible: there is an average of 3.42 doctors per 10,000 people in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to 39.0 doctors per 10,000 people in Europe. These issues contribute to a faulty healthcare ecosystem that disproportionately affects women. </p>
<p>Lack of access to sexual and reproductive health and rights has a detrimental impact on individuals and communities. It leads to higher maternal death rates and prevents individuals from living healthy and productive lives. It also negatively impacts economic development, as healthy populations are more productive and save more. Furthermore, when women are denied access to healthcare and the ability to make informed decisions, their education and economic opportunities are limited, further perpetuating gender inequality in their communities. By addressing the problem of inadequate access to women's health in emerging markets, Grace Health aims to improve the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities.</p>","<p>Our solution begins by building with intention, taking into account both the low-resource environment of our target market and the low health literacy of our users.

Grace Health will give women the power to carve out their life path by equipping them with health access and education. We will allow them to participate in active family planning, monitor symptoms to prevent the worsening of underlying conditions, and build a health agency. In turn, they can pursue education, gain employment, and actively contribute to their community's economy and future development. </p>","<p>Over the past five years, our team has successfully built Grace Health to be the #1 health app trusted across Sub-Saharan Africa. Our team is nimble and backed by years of experience in emerging markets, driving positive change through social impact, and working on digital service and product development. Founder and CEO Estelle Westling launched Kinnevik-backed Tonaton Ghana, Ghana's leading marketplace, which in less than two years established itself as more well-known than Youtube with a team of 70 employees. Prior to Grace Health, co-founder Therese Mannheimer was the Head of R&amp;D at the market-leading health app Lifesum and spent six years as a partner and strategist at the global design firm Doberman. We have also made it a point to have team members located directly in the regions we serve, primarily Nigeria and Kenya. Currently, we have two members of our team in Nigeria working in Product Design and Product Management. Our team in Kenya is dedicated to Social Media Coordination, Sales and Marketing Management, and Backend Engineering. By employing a global team, we remain involved in the markets we serve, and as such, can provide an even better solution. We keep the marketing team in Kenya so that they can create content, design, campaigns and offerings that correspond to the trends they can see in their communities. As such, they can get at the heart of our users as they can sympathise with and relate to the same problems and opportunities. </p>
<p>In terms of our solution, understanding our customer drives the betterment of our product. By analysing the engagement with our app we can deduce the services most utilised by our customers. For example, recent data has shown that 93% use the symptom tracker, 80% use the chat, 66% use the period tracker and 60% rely on educational content. By taking this data we can improve our services and also use the engagement data to personalise the content to specific customers. We further understand needs through frequent user interviews and collecting feedback directly from the app itself. </p>","Improve accessibility and quality of health services for underserved groups in fragile contexts around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, LGBTQ+ individuals, etc.)",Stockholm,Sweden,"Growth: An organization with an established product, service, or business model that is rolled out in one or more communities",,"<p>We currently serve 1.3 million women across Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa. </p>","<p>We are applying to MIT Solve because it’s important that we collaborate with organisations that believe in our goal of democratising health access and information.

Through leadership coaching and evaluation support, our goal is to further improve the in-app services for our customers. We are currently building a community currency system in order to allow our customers to receive further medical attention.

In order to build out this feature, we are seeking a partner that believes in an equal and accessible healthcare system for a market of women who are so often overlooked. </p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Human Capital (e.g. sourcing talent, board development), Legal or Regulatory Matters, Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact)","No, Solve is the first network joined",,Google or other search engine,<p>We discovered Solve’s 2023 Global Challenges through a Google search.</p>,"<p>Existing solutions in our markets are Flo, Clue, Babylon Health and Nabta Health. These solutions fail as they have developed services for the Western customer which sets them up to provide niche value to those who can afford the data and bandwidth to use their services. They have not taken into consideration the low data resource settings of emerging markets, nor have they accounted for the lack of purchasing power. Moreover, current solutions are rational, not relational. For intimate concerns on reproductive health, women want a relational approach in terms of content tonality and service delivery. Google is also a substitute since it distributes health information and advice, however, the search engine has several limits. Firstly, users do not know what information to trust or who is qualified to give out information. Secondly, like the other solutions available, Google does not take a relational role which hinders conversations about the topics that our users want to address.</p>
<p>The Grace app is built specifically for emerging markets and the next billion users, unlike any other solution available. The lean design of the app is in itself an innovation as it opens up the market to more women who are prone to low bandwidth environments - the reality of most people in Sub-Saharan Africa. As such, the addressable market for our innovation is much larger than that of other solutions as we can target those others cannot. However, the true innovation lies in our health reward system. This is a groundbreaking innovation that truly has the power to transform health outcomes across the continent. By addressing an actual macro-need such as unaffordability of healthcare, we pave the way for free healthcare unlike any other available solution. No competitor is close to achieving the level of trusted community currency as that built by Grace Health, and as a result, we are the only solution where She can access cheaper care. </p>","<p><strong>Our impact goals for the next year are to: </strong></p>

<ul><li><p>Shift attitudes towards contraception and immunisation. </p></li></ul><p>In order to reach this impact goal, we must succeed in two aspects. Firstly, we must continue to strengthen our relationship with our local HCP providers, but we also need to expand the network. In order to distribute significant numbers of vaccines and contraceptives, users must have a healthcare clinic in proximity to their homes. As such, we need to integrate even more partner clinics into our network. Simultaneously, we need to run awareness programs and work with motivation and capability towards behaviour change and intention to shift behaviour and for our users to opt for last mile care for immunisation or family planning counselling.    </p>
<p><strong>Our impact goals for the next five years:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p>2 million users using modern contraceptives</p></li></ul><p>We will achieve this goal by pushing educational content to our non LARC (users not currently on any long-term reversible contraceptives) users. In collaboration with pharmaceutical partners, we will bust myths and fight stigma, create awareness of the benefits of contraceptives, and thereafter provide access to a gynecologists who can prescribe a suitable contraceptive. </p>

72277,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,"NeuroSole is a portable, cheap, non-invasive, and easy-to-use early diagnostic system for Parkinson’s disease.","<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) has the fastest-rising prevalence of all neurological diseases, affecting up to 10 million individuals. In addition, in 2022 nearly 90,000 patients have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s, a steep 50% increase from preceding years, making it the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States. </p>
<p>For diagnosis, patients have to go through numerous exhaustive, expensive, and time-consuming tests such as DaTscan, MRI, and PET scans to rule out other diseases. Patients also spend an average of $2,500 to obtain the necessary examinations before diagnosis. The symptoms of Parkinson’s are also similar to that of Lewy body dementia, and muscular dystrophy, making it even harder for doctors to diagnose Parkinson’s. </p>
<p>Currently, Parkinson's is misdiagnosed up to 30% of the time and according to Parkinson’s UK 34% of people that were misdiagnosed reported a decline in health. This leads many patients to develop Parkinson's symptoms 1-2 years before their official diagnosis, leading to worsened conditions and chronic symptoms. Moreover, according to ParkinsonsDisease.net, “diagnosing PD early is important because treatments such as levodopa/carbidopa are more effective when administered early on in the disease.” Thus, the increase in  late or misdiagnosis leads to ineffectiveness of medications and ongoing progression of the disease. </p>
<p>Altogether, due to a lack of an accessible, affordable, and accurate diagnostic system available for patients in the early stages prevents them from taking further action in order to slow the progression of the disease.</p>","<p>NeuroSole is a novel diagnostic tool that utilizes a 1D convolutional neural networks model to analyze Parkinsonian gait patterns, which are one of the earliest symptoms in Parkinson’s. To obtain data points regarding one's gait, each pair of NeuroSole insoles are embedded with 12 pressure sensors to transmit the ground reaction forces to the 1D convolutional neural network model. The sensors placed in the insoles of the shoe record the pressure points during each phase of the gait cycle. To accurately assess the patient's gait, six sensors are positioned in each insole: one sensor near the toes, two in the metatarsal region, one in the midfoot, and two near the heel. The data points collected by the sensors are sent from the Arduino Uno to the Raspberry Pi which then sends the data to the cloud where the data is processed and used to detect the likelihood of developing Parkinson’s using the 1D-Convnet model.   </p>
<p>NeuroSole comes with the insoles and a free downloadable app. The app displays the results of the examination, allows users to monitor symptoms, and share results with caregivers. To use NeuroSole, the user has to download the app on their mobile, insert the insoles into their shoes and enable the app to start tracking. After a short walk of 2-3 minutes, the app immediately reports the likelihood of developing PD and if desired the results can be shared with caregivers. Patients can use our product on a regular basis to monitor the progression.  </p>
<p>To develop the model, the 1D CNN algorithm was used as it can perform activity recognition tasks such as standing, walking, or jumping. We also used software applications like the Raspberry Pi OS and the Arduino IDE to read in the sensor values and develop the model. </p>

The psychographics are individuals looking for immediate, cheap, and non-invasive alternatives to diagnose Parkinson’s in its early stages. This also includes individuals who are cautious about their health, have poor health records, or could possibly inherit the disease from close family members. The secondary target market includes disorder movement specialists and neurologists who want to verify the diagnosis results and monitor their patient's symptoms and progression over long gaps between visits. Our very first customers include patients at local hospitals, neurologist's clinics, and the elderly individuals in our local community. </p>
<p>Currently our target market doesn’t have other alternatives on the market to accurately diagnose Parkinson’s in its early stages in the comfort of the homes. Our product aims to provide an effective solution where users can diagnose in the comfort of the homes while intervening at the proper time to make treatments such as Carbidopa-levodopa more effective at managing symptoms. Through our product, we hope to increase the effectiveness of medication and decrease the number of patients that are misdiagnosed in the coming years. In the long run, NeuroSole can provide individuals with peace of mind and allow them to lead active and independent lives. </p>","<p>My twin sister and I have decided to work together on creating a life-changing product that draws from our shared life experiences and knowledge. This problem matters to us because our grandfather was diagnosed with stage 3 Parkinson's, which made us recognize the invaluable need for tools that can help patients to diagnose neurological diseases like Parkinson’s in its early stages. The community of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases remain very close to our heart. Our experience motivates us to create a product that will assist millions of patients worldwide to take necessary medications at the appropriate time. Our product will aid neurologists by streamlining the diagnostic process and simultaneously helping patients take preventative care as needed. </p>
<p>Currently, our product was also recognized by the Global Conrad Challenge where our project received the Power Pitch award from among 950+ teams. In addition, we have already applied for a provisional patent on the integration of sensors onto the insoles. Furthermore, we have a strong background in computer science as we both advanced to the finals in ACSL, and are currently silver contestants in USACO. Moreover, we have strong fundamentals in business and have been competitively successful in DECA by placing in ICDC, which will allow us to build a strong business model for our company. In addition, in our first two years of high school we performed extensive research on neurodegenerative disease similar to Parkinson’s and received statistically significant results and even published the results in the Harvard Journal of Emerging Investigators. We have also been recognized for our research on neurodegenerative disorders by the city council and mayor.

We also plan to use transfer learning to continue to train and redefine the parameters of our AI model. We also plan to focus on ensuring high accessibility of our products by making them portable, and easy to use, without intervening with other activities. Thus, our product can be used simultaneously as the user walks, not intervening with other activities and plans. Finally, we focus on being an affordable device by charging $250 for a pair of insoles and $5 for a one time download of the app. In addition, in the future we plan on incorporating a renting option for 1-3 days for $30 to $60 to reduce the financial burden faced by patients and instead provide a cost effective solution with long term uses. </p>

In addition, we have also taken the steps to discuss our future plans and the current functionality, comfort and uses of our MVP with our local neurologists. As this feedback can ensure a high customer satisfaction before we launch into the market. </p>","<p>NeuroSole is a novel diagnostic tool that finds abnormalities in the walk by utilizing gait patterns, one of the earliest symptoms in Parkinson’s. To develop the hardware of our product, we embedded 12 pressure sensors in a pair of insoles to transmit the ground reaction forces to the 1D convolutional neural network model. The sensors record the pressure points during each phase of the gait cycle. To accurately assess the patient's gait, six sensors are positioned in each insole: one sensor near the toes, two in the metatarsal region, one in the midfoot, and two near the heel. The data points collected by the sensors are sent to the Arduino Uno which serves as an analog-to-digital converter. The Arduino Uno digitizes the sensor signal and transmits it via a serial protocol to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi then sends the data to the cloud where the data is processed and used to detect the likelihood of developing Parkinson’s using the 1D-Convnet model.   </p>
<p>In order to develop the AI model, the Gait in Parkinson's Disease dataset was obtained from PhysioNet. The dataset is a collection of multichannel recordings from force sensors beneath the feet of 93 patients with Parkinson's Disease and 73 healthy controls. The dataset contains the vertical component of the ground reaction forces from the sensors placed on the insole of each foot. For the data pre-processing, the first and last 15 seconds of the walking were removed to ignore the starting and stopping disturbances. Furthermore, for the feature extraction, the most prominent features were analyzed such as swing time, stride time, gait asymmetry, and double stance time for both feet. In order to build and train the model we utilized the 1D convolutional neural networks algorithm.  </p>
<p>The AI model reports the likelihood of developing Parkinson’s on the NeuroSole app after the user walks for a few minutes.

72726,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,"TumiApp is a mobile application that uses Artificial Intelligence with the ability to gamify the self-care of patients and families with limited literacy skills in rural areas. The current proposal focuses on the design, implementation and measurement for the prevention of the disease","<p>TB is a cone-shaped infectious disease that kills millions of people every year worldwide, especially young women in economically vulnerable situations. In Latin America, hundreds of thousands of cases are reported each year, with Colombia being one of the countries most affected by the disease, particularly in the department of Cauca due to its low development index and difficult socio-economic situation. Generally, the regions that are most affected by the disease, especially in Cauca, involve people belonging to various ethnic groups or mix raced communities, such as Afro-descendants, indigenous people and peasants. In addition, these communities have low scholarity, limiting skills such as reading or writing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, health systems have tried to alleviate the consequences of TB through treatments that ensure a better quality of life for patients, as well as raising awareness among their families and large communities. However, many patients find it difficult to successfully follow treatments and physicians’ recommendations that contribute to self-care. This is due to several factors including: lack of education about the disease or how to properly take care of themselves, lack of access to health services, lack of resources to access treatment, and lack of emotional and social support. For this reason, tools are urgently needed to knock down barriers, especially technological ones, given the geographical difficulties that patients in these regions may face.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, due to the rise in Information Technology and its exponential development during the last decades, there are more people who have access to mobile device allowing them to not only communicate with their families but also be in contact with the exterior world. In this sense, tools for mobile devices (apps) have shown themselves to be promising alternatives that allow users to interact with the most modern trends related to various issues but especially in relation to the monitoring, treatment and support of a chronic disease. In the case of this project, mobile technology becomes an instrument to improve and strengthen the results of a follow-up and monitoring program, as well as the possibility of providing greater adherence to treatments in general. Studies developed in India, Africa, the USA, the UK and Moldova, among other countries, show that the use of mobile applications has improved anti-tuberculosis treatments and self-care.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>The TumiApp is an innovative solution to address the problem of the lack of TB literacy in the rural region of the department of Cauca, especially in areas with a high density of vulnerable communities. This application seeks to improve the self-care of TB patients and their families through the effective use of gamification and visual interaction with a virtual character called Tumi who follows the concept of a kind of Tamagotchi, which means that he requires constant care and attention from the user, thereby creating an emotional bond. Through interaction with Tumi, patients and their families can learn about TB, preventive measures, the importance of treatment compliance and self-care. In addition, TumiApp allows patients to be accompanied and their quality of life and that of their families to be improved indirectly.</p>
<p> It is worth to mention that the Tumi character has been conceived without any particular ethnic or gender affiliation, which makes it more adaptable to a community without any distinction and can generate greater sense so belonging without being intrusive to the socio-cultural environment of the patients and their close circle. Furthermore, the application itself allows for inclusivity in the sense that it has been conceived for people with literacy limitations through the effective use of images, graphic symbols, audio, and animations.</p>","<p>TumiApp is designed for TB patients and their families living in the municipalities of the department of Cauca: (1) Santander de Quilichao, (2) Villarrica, (3) Puerto Tejada, (4) Caldono and (5) Piendamó. It should be noted that both patients and their families face a number of challenges such as limited access to information about the disease, little understanding of the importance of treatment, difficulties in complying with supervised treatment and lack of knowledge about self-care, in addition to limitations in literacy skills.
  </p>
<p>Thus, TumiApp offers a solution to the above problems by providing clear and accessible information related to TB, its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and self-care measures during the course of the disease and disease remission conditions. The app also offers medication reminders, schedules for check-ups and medical appointments, as well as tools for monitoring treatment progress and psycho-emotional support when needed.<br /></p>
<p> Also, the use of Artificial Intelligence for gamification allows the application to be more interactive and attractive to patients with limited reading and writing skills, which generates a better understanding and participation in the treatment, as well as activities designated by the program agent for self-care. In addition to the above, the application increases the local capacity of hospitals covering the rural environment of the region, favors interaction with health professionals, patients can more easily adapt to self-care interventions, and increases the quality of treatment adherence monitoring in patients with low health system coverage who are located in fragile contexts, thus improving health outcomes at the primary care level.
  
 Specifically, TumiiApp can have a significant impact on the lives of patients and their families by improving understanding of the disease and increasing adherence to treatment, improving health outcomes, strengthening the self-care capacities of patients, their families and neighbors through word of mouth communication about TB self-care knowledge and health practices, bringing health services closer to the communities and reducing the cost of health care as well as the burden of disease in rural and dispersed areas of the department of Cauca, becoming a pilot and a national benchmark.</p>","<p>The team has experience in application development, research and creation projects, as well as in design and programming of mobile applications, user experience, interface design, user research, digital illustration, animation and software development methodologies with researchers from the CAMALEÓN research group of the Universidad del Valle and the Information Technology R&amp;D Group -GTI- of the Universidad del Cauca.</p>

<p> The team will be responsible for establishing a baseline in relation to the knowledge of the subject in patients and their close circle, as well as the characteristics of connectivity (individual and georeferenced) and access to mobile units through a mixed study. For the development of the application, user research will be carried out and, based on task scripts, mental models will be discovered with the aim of defining conceptual models according to their particularities based on Experience Design.</p>
<p> In addition to the above, the team ensures the development of the application and its adaptation following the premises of User-Centred Design and Accessibility taking into account literacy limitations. Summarising, the steps of the ""Design Research Process"" (DRP) will be considered as a valid methodology of scientific research and development of application projects, composed of 6 phases; 1) identification of the problem according to the results of the interdisciplinary diagnosis and the assessment with a group of experts in the problem, 2) establishing objectives of the solution, 3) design and implementation, 4) piloting, 5) measurement and 6) communication.</p>
<p>In measuring or testing the usability and functionality of the TumiApp tool, medium and high-fidelity prototypes will be used, as well as User eXperience -UX- evaluation methods.

73183,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,Providing health care services under the most extreme conditions by leveraging on technology and enhanced application of existing structures.,"<p>Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country with over 200 million inhabitants, many of them underserved. There are multiple challenges in accessing adequate healthcare for a large proportion of the populace, particularly for the hard to reach communities .During COVID 19 Pandemic for instance, access to health care was constrained due to lack of adequate isolation centres and transportation challenges to access the available ones due to the restricted movement amid social distancing measures. As a consequence the WHO states that as of March 2023, only about 14% of the total population has received the booster dose, a far cry from the required 70% that ensures herd immunity. The focus of our solution is on the hard-to-reach areas with limited access to the healthcare system where a large proportion of Nigeria’s inhabitants live.</p>
<p>Nigeria has a primary-healthcare system with an administrative unit of the local government areas. There is a central Local government Area store in each LGA of the federation which should be stocked from the state Central store with medicines, vaccines and other essential supplies. However, there is a preponderance of stockouts at the LGA level. 
  </p>
<p>The health centre and dispensary is the basic unit of primary healthcare which is usually managed by a health worker. 
</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>Our solution is two-fold. First, the establishment (or activation where they already exist) of mobile medical teams including at least a community health extension workers and at least one support staff  using enhanced tricycles to provide medical outreach services to the hard to reach communities. A selection of specific tricycle operators in the host communities in order to leverage on existing structures will be employed. These enhanced tricycles can also serve as ambulances to bring the sick to the secondary level care centre in cases of need and should be equipped with telemedicine facilities to allow the remote follow-up of patients on chronic care and consultation of emergent cases.</p>
<p>The second part will be the use of drones to manage stockouts of vaccines and other essential supplies and medicines from the state central store to the LGA stores and in dire emergencies, delivery of medical supplies directly to the patients.
  </p>
<p>Our solution would be piloted in one state of Nigeria ( Kebbi State), with 21 LGAs. One drone and a back up will be deployed at the state level with 23 enhanced tricycles (including 2 back-ups). The ambulances will be staffed and manned by staff from the state primary healthcare development agency and the referral hospital for telemedicine consultation and referral of patients will be General Hospital Argungu in Kebbi state.
</p>","<p>Prompt access to health care will ensure the curtailing of unneccessary deaths and medical complications arising from lack of adequate medical care. Rural outreach will be enhanced, and the cost and quality of health care services will be greatly improved, as more effort can be deployed in improving the standard of already established and functional secondary health care facilities rather than increasing the number of primary health care facilites which comes with added cost and maintenance challenges. The new primary healthcare facilities also tend to be moribund after just a few years of establishment as experience has shown, with the aim of their establsihment summarily defeated.

This solution intends to address the challenges of inadequate healthcare access, exacerbated during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, by leveraging technology and optimizing existing healthcare infrastructure.

The first component of the solution involves deploying mobile medical teams equipped with enhanced tricycles. These teams, comprising community health extension workers and support staff, aim to provide medical outreach services directly to communities in need. The tricycles, aside from facilitating outreach, are designed to serve as ambulances and are equipped with telemedicine capabilities for remote patient follow-up and emergency consultations.

The second component focuses on the use of drones to alleviate stockouts of essential medical supplies, vaccines, and medicines by facilitating prompt delivery from state central stores to LGA stores and, in urgent cases, directly to patients.

The proposal specifies the pilot implementation in Kebbi State, detailing the allocation of one drone and a backup unit at the state level, alongside 23 enhanced tricycles, including two backups, to support the initiative. This structure is planned to work in collaboration with the state primary healthcare development agency and General Hospital Argungu for telemedicine consultations and patient referrals.

The target beneficiaries are the residents of hard-to-reach areas, with the solution aiming to significantly reduce unnecessary deaths and medical complications by improving prompt access to healthcare services.

73437,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,A mobile app for at-risk populations to track their health with trusted tips and remain under the radar of local rescue squads during natural disasters.,"<p>Mass disasters such as earthquakes can cause a loss of electricity or flooding, making it difficult for people with chronic health diseases to continue using life-sustaining equipment. With obstructed communication and widespread panic, they may also be unable to contact emergency care – especially if they are socially isolated.</p>
<p>This issue is present on a global scale, with an average of 60,000 people dying from natural disasters yearly. This number grows as power failures may continue and injuries can increase the risk of death. <br /></p>
<p>However, we can reduce the risk of fatal injuries with CARS. By ensuring that rescue squads check in with registered patients, our solution addresses the communication failure that is often associated with these large-scale disasters. Our team has first-hand witnessed the impact of floods and power outages on at-risk populations in New Jersey, and aims to improve the lives of these populations.<br /></p>
<p>This includes the daily lives as well. Around 50% of Parkinson's patients suffer from depression, as do approximately 20% of people with a cardiovascular disease. The mental health of these patients isn't the best, and with the increasing stigma surrounding this topic, it must also be addressed. <br /></p>
<p>Hence, by building an online community for people with similar diseases to interact and learn, we hope to make patients feel less isolated. We hope to improve the lives of registered people and protect them under all scenarios.<br /></p>","<p>Our solution aims to assist and prepare at-risk populations in the event of a natural disaster. First, we reach past the communication barrier that may exist with technological failure by connecting registered patients with local rescue squads. When patients register with CARS, they enter their address, so that we can link them to nearby health agencies. In the event of a disaster, these groups will physically seek out patients during disasters to confirm their safety or transport them to a treatment facility if need be. </p>
<p>Next, CARS helps people control and understand their conditions so that they or their loved ones may see what to do during an emergency. It does so by acting as a daily calendar for the patient. Every day, the patient may update their condition with their progression, new symptoms, vitals, etc. and receive a tip based on how they are doing. In doing so, we hope to educate people so that they can understand their body and what is best for it.</p>
<p>Finally, to create a safe and supportive community for patients to grow and learn together, CARS has a chatting system. With consent, we connect members to people with similar disabilities so that they can share experiences with one another or provide advice.</p>","<p>Our solution primarily serves at-risk populations such as the elderly or at-home patients with chronic health diseases. In particular, CARS would address those who have their lives endangered during disasters. For example, being attached to a ventilator or a home dialysis machine during a power failure can stop people from receiving the care that they need.</p>
<p>Our solution has the potential to save the lives of these populations during disasters as they would have prioritized access to medical care regardless of whether they are able to call an emergency facility or not. They would not need to risk their lives by waiting on medical care or transport, and by remaining under the radar of rescue squads, their safety can drastically improve.</p>
<p>Additionally, through our online chatting community, they can reach out to people with similar experiences, stopping them from feeling lonely. Studies show that around 1/3 of patients with a serious chronic illness suffer from feelings of depression as well. However, by understanding what they can do to help themselves with CARS' recording system, and by talking about their symptoms with people who suffer from similar things, their mental health can also improve.</p>","<p>Our team members reside in parts of New Jersey that are especially diverse. We often engage with people of all ages that experience poverty or are significantly restrained by medical conditions. During disasters, these people are in the most need of help, which is why we hope to develop a system that can ensure their safety during emergencies. By speaking to the loved ones of those who cannot live without medical technology, it is clear to us that their biggest worries during disasters are not themselves, but their family member.</p>
<p>With members working as emergency medical technicians, we are exposed to these at-risk populations on a daily basis. Additionally, by reaching out to local hospitals, we have a deep understanding of the serious care that some require. For these people who require significant medical attention but may lack representation for themselves, the most important thing is having others reach out so that they can feel safe during an emergency situation.</p>","Improve accessibility and quality of health services for underserved groups in fragile contexts around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, LGBTQ+ individuals, etc.)",Somerset County,United States,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone","<p>Our solution is currently in development, as our product is in its primary stages of development.

This solution, named CARS, specifically caters to individuals with chronic health diseases who may face life-threatening situations when disasters disrupt power supplies or communication facilities. Highlighting the global impact of natural disasters, with an average of 60,000 deaths annually, the proposal emphasizes the exacerbated risk for individuals reliant on life-sustaining medical equipment, further complicated by social isolation and communication barriers.

CARS functions by registering patients, capturing their addresses, and linking them with nearby health agencies for physical check-ins during disasters.

This solution aims to directly serve the poorest populations in Brazil, notably in rural areas, and the outskirts of cities with up to 50,000 inhabitants, including a broad demographic of men, women, elderly, youth, and children. The motivation behind this initiative is to bridge the gap in healthcare delivery by facilitating early interventions and preventive care to avert or mitigate the seriousness of health conditions before individuals require care from Basic Health Units (UBS).

This model is built on the principle of using local health agents, who are members of the communities they serve, to deliver health guidance and support door-to-door. The local nature of the workforce is anticipated to increase the effectiveness of the program, given the agents' familiarity with the specific health challenges and dynamics of their communities.

The solution is in the Prototype stage, inspired by the Family Health program initiated by the Brazilian government in 1994. However, it proposes an innovation by insisting that health agents belong to the communities where they work, unlike the government program. This approach is positioned as a more integrated and community-specific strategy to enhance primary healthcare outcomes.

The team behind this proposal, based out of São Luís, Maranhão, believes in its capacity to implement this model effectively due to its understanding of the local context, the availability of a workforce within the municipalities, and the support of community leaders known to the organization. The Instituto Tassio Rocha, leading the initiative, currently does not serve the public with this action but declares readiness to operationalize the solution.

The organization seeks support from Solve primarily for funding, alongside assistance in refining the business model and financial strategies to ensure the program's sustainability and scalability. This request implies a recognition of financial barriers as the primary challenge to the initiative's execution, despite the team's confidence in overcoming other obstacles.

74321,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,We have developed an adaptation that can be used in hemodialysis machines to achieve the function of hemodiafiltration without altering the hardware or software in hemodialysis machines ,"<p>
Quantum Medical is a company incorporated in Ecuador, whose may goal is to
deliver solutions to health disparities in the world, especially for Chronic
Kidney Disease patients.</p>
<p>We
have developed an adaptation that can be used in hemodialysis machines to
achieve the function of hemodiafiltration. This treatment has been shown to
provide advantages over conventional hemodialysis, including various clinical
advantages and overall improvement of chronic kidney patient survival.</p>
<p>The
Scale of the problem:</p>
<p>Chronic
kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition that affects &gt;10% of the
general population worldwide, amounting to &gt;800 million individuals, &gt;37
million of them in the United States.</p>
<p>Chronic
kidney disease is more prevalent in older individuals, women, racial
minorities, and in people experiencing diabetes mellitus and hypertension. CKD
patients are categorized in 5 stages, the most critical are 3 to 5. These
patients will need dialysis and eventually a transplant. </p>
<p>In the
long term, hemodialysis will continue to be the main treatment for CKD
patients. The percentage of these patients receiving a transplant, is currently
less than 6%. Moreover, future innovations such as bionic kidneys, are in exploratory
stages and they will be available in more than a decade. </p>
<p>Furthermore,
little progress has been made for stage 3-5 CKD patients in regards to
treatment; one being hemodiafiltration. However, the cost of equipment compared
to traditional dialysis makes it unaffordable to patients, and costly for
providers.</p>
<p>Moreover, access to hemodiafiltration is very limited. Not only in
low- and middle-income countries, but also in the USA where the FDA has recentlyapproved its use, with limited access.</p>
<p>What
we do:</p>
<p>We
place a “replacement” filter between the machine and the blood dialysis
filter.  This allows the machine to provide fluid substitution to the
blood (one of the main characteristics of hemodialfiltration), and provide
additional filtering which prevents unnecessary contamination and fouling.</p>
<p>There
are more than 1 million dialysis machines in the world, from different
generations, that can profit from our QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM. Without
reconfiguring (hardware or software) in these machines, we allow them to
perform hemodiafiltration.</p>
<p>Thus, our innovation allows CKD patients to have access to a better treatment, improve their wellbeing at affordable prices, as well as benefiting health providers by extending their service portfolio without having to invest large sums of money in new equipment. </p>","<p>The performance of hemodialysis machines has improved over the past few decades, with newer machines offering more precise flow control from simple extracorporeal circulation devices without volumetric control, with low blood flow and low-flux dialyzers to precisely controlling devices. Thus, the clearence efficiency of older machines becomes less accurate, impacting their dialysis performance. Moreover, hemodialysis machines are costly pieces of equipment. In under-resourced geographical regions and societies, purchasing a new set of machines at each dialysis clinic is not always economically viable or environmentally responsible. Therefore, cost-effective methods to alter older but fully functional machines to achieve performance comparable to that of newer machines are highly desirable. <br />We have created a convertion system for reconfiguring existing hemodialysis machines to perform hemodiafiltration, as hemodiafiltration has been shown to provide advantages over conventional hemodialysis, including various clinical advantages and overall improvement of patient survival.<br />As mentioned before, older hemodialysis machines cannot be used for these purposes as they do not have any included functionality to provide fluid substitution to the blood. The QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM strives to make use of the existing functionalities of the hemodialysis machine to achieve this, by using an additional dialysis filter, termed the “replacement<br />filter.” The primary purpose of this filter is to separate the dialysate inflow into two streams – one for dialysis, and the other for fluid substitution. There is a minor secondary purpose of this filter, which is to filter the dialysate prior to entering the hemodialysis filter which prevents any unnecessary contamination and fouling.<br />An average hemodialysis machine controls the inflow and outflow of the dialysate to maintain the ultrafiltration rate specified via user input. The QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM takes advantage of this control to achieve more ultrafiltration than possible in a typical hemodialysis configuration. By partitioning a portion of the dialysate inflow for substitution, the actual dialysate outflow is lower than the dialysate outflow expected by the machine. As such, the dialysate is pumped out at a flow rate higher than anticipated, resulting in a higher actual ultrafiltration rate. While it is possible to increase the ultrafiltration rate manually in conventional hemodialysis, this may result in dehydration in the patient if increased excessively. With substitution of dialysate to the patient as found in hemodiafiltration, this would not be an issue.<br />An in-vitro perfomance test, carried out by the CBB-University of Waterloo, concluded that the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM appears to yield a better performance as compared to conventional hemodialysis when using the same parameters, such as blood and dialysate flow rate due to the increased ultrafiltration generated from the hemodialysis machine. The QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM resulted in increased urea clearance, there does not seem to be any significant effect of albumin loss or increase in hemolysis. <br />Overall, our CONVERSION SYSTEM aligns with the United Nations’ objective of promoting equitable access to healthcare, which seeks to ensure that all individuals have access to high-quality healthcare services regardless of their economic or social status.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>We aim to improve the lives of CKD patients around the world, who have limited access to better treatments because of economic constrains. There are 800 million patients worldwide and 1 million dialysis machines who can benefit directly from the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM. The majority of CKD Patients in stage 3 to 5, receive basic dialysis treatments. Hemodiafiltration is known to outperform conventional Hemodialysis, offering more effective waste clearance and better fluid balance to patients. However, the price difference between a HDF (Hemodiafiltration) and a HD (Hemodialysis) machine is 25,000 to 30,000 dollars. Therefore, the great majority of stage 3-5 CKD patients have no real possibility to receive HDF.</p>
<p>The QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM has also been reported by CBB to shorten the time needed for HD sessions, allowing to increase the number of sessions (and patients) per machine in 25%. This means that an average dialysis machine that serves 4 patients per day, if they use the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM can increase its service by 1 patient per day. 
  </p>
<p>Therefore, the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM improves the wellbeing of stage 3-5 CKD patients by increasing their urea and albumina clearance. Allows for health providers to strengthen the quality of care for CKD patients, as well as to increase the number of HD sessions per machine.
</p>","<p>At the beginning, we were a team of three:
  </p>
<p>•Laura Torres, Ph.D. in Health Promotion from the University of Aarhus, Denmark; scientific advisor for the Inter American Global Change Institute.
  </p>
<p>•Bernardo Canizares, M. Phil from the University of Bergen, Norway; entrepreneur in health services.
  </p>
<p>•Cesar Vasconez, M.D. Nephrologist and inventor. Recently deceased. 
  </p>
<p>In 2020 Cesar Vasconez died of cancer, and after much soul searching we decided to continue developing THE QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM on his memory. Dr. Vasconez created IARE, Institute of Nephrology Research based in Quito-Ecuador. In IARE he cared for thousands of CKD patients referred by the public heath system.</p>
<p>In Ecuador CKD is considered by law a catastrophic illness, whereby access to care is paid by the public system (Ministry of Health and Social Security), while delivered by private providers. Although the scheme provides for free health care for CKD patients, this has had some negative impact on care capacity. Providers receive a fixed price per patient, as well as a permanent number of patients. Therefore, there is little room for more patients although CKD increases 10% per year.<br /></p>
<p>This leaves little room for providers to innovate or use updated technology. Thus, Dr. Vasconez looked for ways to improve patient care with limited budgets. He developed the earlier stage of the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM as well as other inventions. 
  </p>
<p>He started using the CONVERSION SYSTEM in more than 40,000 treatments leaving a trail of critical data, that was lost after he died. Meanwhile, Dr. Torres and Bernardo Canizares partnered with Dr. Vasconez to further developed and patent the QUATUM CONVERSION SYSTEM, after they worked on an epidemiological and health system analysis of the CKD emerging public health crisis in Ecuador (<a href=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.19.21252087v1"">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.19.21252087v1</a>) 
  </p>
<p>In order to further develop this and other treatments, the three members incorporated a limited liability company called QUANTUM MEDICAL SERVICES. Couple months before Cesar Vasconez died, we received funding from Ecuador’s National Science Secretariat to improve and introduce in markets the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM. We developed the next stage from the initial prototypes developed by Cesar, based on the date collected by in-vitro tests done by the CBB-University of Waterloo. </p>
<p>We partnered with the Center of Bioengineering at the University of Waterloo, Canada, in order to carry out validation tests. The results have been promising and support Dr. Vasconez earlier work; the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM allows average dialysis machines (without reconfiguring their hardware or software) to provide hemodiafiltration. A pear-review paper has already been submitted to Hemodialysis International and we are expecting its publication by July 2023.

Our talent and ingenuity has created a viable solution to a big problem, and it can develop even more in partnership with SOLVE and MIT’s resources and knowledge. Together with SOLVE we can further develop the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM by designing and conducting a clinical trial that will allow us to introduce our innovation in multiple regions and markets, and it will strengthen our vision and approach in those regions where we are already aiming to introduce our product. We will also be able to design a strategic approach towards its implementation in a diversity of health services and systems around the globe. Finally, we want to connect with partners that will be interested to try our solution in the US market, where care for CKD patients is similar to low and middle income countries. Also to learn about  and navigate regulatory and market barriers in the United States and Africa in order to introduce the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM in those markets and regions. </p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Legal or Regulatory Matters","Yes, this solution is already (or has been in the past) a part of other networks",<p>Innovacyt supported by the Ecuador's National Science Scretariat </p>,Word of mouth,<p>An acquaintance sent us the information and thought it could be useful for our solution </p>,"<p>We have created a solution that provides access to hemodiafiltration to 3-5 stage CKD patients, regardless of their economic status. Our product allows exiting dialysis machines (low and high flow) to deliver hemodiafiltration treatment at a much lower price, translating into a significant improvement in the wellbeing of these patients.  
  </p>
<p>This is a positive development for medical practice in regions where access to hemodialysis is limited, and hemodiafiltration is nonexistent (including the United States). The in-vitro validation test has also recorded a higher efficiency rate of our product compared to an average dialysis session. A dialysis machine services 4 patients per day, with our product they can attend to 5 patients per day. The QUATUM CONVERSION SYSTEM can improve the capacity of health providers by shortening the dialysis sessions by 25%, and increasing the number of patients treated per machine. However, this has to be tested on a clinical trial. 
  </p>
<p>By improving the efficiency of machines and allowing access to better dialysis treatment, the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM is catalyst of change in regards to health equity in the world. If implemented, health systems can expand services and improve the lives of patients; two of the main problems related to Chronic Kidney Disease. 
</p>","<p>In the coming year we expect to commercialize the QUANTUM CONVERSION SYSTEM in Ecuador, where there are about 50 dialysis clinics (franchised, public and independent) with a market projection of 800 to 1000 dialysis machines. We will also present our design patent and obtain our utility patent in Ecuador. In 2024 we expect to carry a clinical trial to validate the in-vitro results and introduce our conversion system in Peru, where there are about 60 dialysis clinics and 600 to 700 machines. We will also present our patent in Peru, Colombia, Mexico and Argentina. By 2025 we expect to introduce our system to the Colombian, Argentinian and Mexican markets, and convert by this year more than 2000 machines.

</li></ol>","<p>The Hemodialysis process is based on an anatomic principle performed by kidneys. Their main job is to remove waste from the blood and return the cleaned blood back to the body. Each minute about one litre of blood – one-fifth of all the blood pumped by the heart – enters the kidneys through the renal arteries. After the blood is cleaned, it flows back into the body through the renal veins. Chronic Kidney Disease Patients have a gradual loss of kidney function. Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body, and for that reason 3-5 stage CKD patients need hemodialysis: an external machine powered process that mimics kidney functions. 
  Developing on the evidence-based research done by Dr. Vasconez, we give dialysis filters a utilitarian alternative use, by assembling a conversion system that allows low and high flux dialysis machines to perform a higher and more accurate cleansing and filtering process that obtains a higher urea cleaning rate, a lower albumina and hemolisis loss.

This adaptation allows conventional hemodialysis machines to perform hemodiafiltration without any modification to the machine's hardware or software. Hemodiafiltration offers clinical advantages and improves survival rates for patients with CKD over standard hemodialysis. The solution targets a significant health issue: CKD affects over 800 million people worldwide, with a greater prevalence in specific populations and those with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Given the high cost and limited access to hemodiafiltration, Quantum Medical's adaptation presents a potential for widespread impact by making this advanced treatment more accessible.

The solution has reached a pilot stage of development, demonstrated by its application in over 40,000 treatments, indicating a transition from concept to testing with a small user base. Quantum Medical seeks to address the scalability of hemodialysis services by enabling existing machines to accommodate more patients without substantial new investments, thereby potentially extending the treatment's reach.

Quantum Medical's approach utilizes an additional filter, dubbed the ""replacement filter,"" to partition the dialysate inflow, allowing for both dialysis and fluid substitution. This system capitalizes on the ultrafiltration control capabilities of average hemodialysis machines to achieve higher efficacy. Initial in-vitro performance tests suggested that this conversion system could outperform conventional hemodialysis in urea clearance without negative side effects such as albumin loss or increased hemolysis.

The team spearheading this innovation is composed of individuals with diverse backgrounds in health promotion, entrepreneurship, and nephrology, highlighting a multidisciplinary approach to tackling CKD treatment limitations. Their work is driven by the aim to improve the health and well-being of stage 3-5 CKD patients across economic boundaries, enhancing health equity.

Quantum Medical's business model is based on a conversion fee per machine and an annual license fee, suggesting a pathway to financial sustainability and scalability. The company has received financial support from Ecuador’s National Secretariat for Innovation and has initiated patent processes in multiple South American countries.

<p>The 2018 WHO AFRO report on the state of health in the WHO African Region shows a staggering health system performance score of 0.49 for the African Region,  showing that health systems are only functioning at a possible 49% of their achievable level of performance. Nearly all countries in the African Region are challenged by critical shortages of health workers, skill-mix imbalance, poor working conditions, weak knowledge base, and maldistribution of health care workers . According to the WHO more than 15,8 million preventable deaths occur annually. More specifically every year 6,2 million paediatric deaths occur of which 47% are neonatal deaths. </p>
<p>A large majority of these children are treated in health facilities before their death. From all paediatric and neonatal deaths, an estimated 50% and 66% respectively could be prevented through improved quality of care. Affordable and effective treatment is usually available, but the conditions are diagnosed too late to be treated effectively. Every hour delay in detecting critical conditions, like sepsis, causes a 10% increase in mortality risk. To a large extent, this is a consequence of health systems being less developed and severely under-resourced. In addition there is an enormous resource gap, in which countries like Malawi (0.5/1000) and Rwanda (1.2/1000) stay far behind the WHO recommended 4,5 health workers per 1000 population. On top of that these health workers are often low qualified and hardly receive any in-service training. This human resource gap will continue to increase up to 2030. Although it may seem logical to build this capacity, this does not take into account that it will take decades to train sufficient numbers of health workers up to a certain standard. In addition, every health worker on the payroll increases pressure on overstrained budgets. </p>
<p>Technology could be used to mitigate many of these challenges. However, the large majority of medical equipment is not designed nor suitable for this context and breaks down in the first years of use, leading to 40-70% of medical equipment failure. Health facilities in LMICs in an African context have significant restrictions on their financial and human resources while facing large patient loads. In essence this means that it is an unbalanced system in which health workers with limited training and experience  are overworked while having insufficient and often unsuitable resources and equipment to serve a large population with complex healthcare needs. At the same time the patients experience different needs and challenges in these settings whereby they often have to travel long distances, have to incur significant expenses and lose out on income if they are utilizing healthcare. Even if their costs are reimbursed,  barriers are high due to the indirect costs incurred. This suboptimal care and high costs lead to large numbers of preventable deaths and impoverishment of patients. </p>","<figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/60455_Kopie%20van%202-page%20GOAL%203%20IMPALA%20Monitor%20Commercial%20Brochure_IBD_MAR2023%20%283%29_1440x810.jpg"" alt=""60455_Kopie%20van%202-page%20GOAL%203%20IMPALA%20Monitor%20Commercial%20Brochure_IBD_MAR2023%20%283%29_1440x810.jpg"" /></figure><p>GOAL 3 has developed the IMPALA solution: a combination of the IMPALA monitoring device for vital signs monitoring wirelessly connected to the IMPALA software that enables health workers to manage and monitor their patients better in a resource constrained environment. This solution allows them to pro-actively detect and manage critical conditions at an early stage when treatments are more effective and low-cost and enables them to allocate time and resources more effectively. It reduces pressure on health workers by reducing workload associated with monitoring and facilitating task redistribution. The IMPALA solution is tailored to the context in collaboration with local implementing partners, ensuring the system fits the needs of the health workers and provides sustainable high value impact.</p>
<p>The IMPALA monitoring device is a multiparameter patient monitor with an intuitive touchscreen that has ECG, pulse-oximeter, non-invasive Blood Pressure, and 2 temperature probes. It continuously measures vital signs: Heart Rate, Pulse rate, oxygen saturation, Respiratory rate, Non-invasive blood pressure and temperature. The system is designed in Malawi and Rwanda with African health workers and biomedical technicians making it intuitive, easy to use and ensuring it is resistant to heat, water, dust (IPX2) and insects. It has a battery life of 6 hours and is designed for portability as it is lightweight (weighs &lt;2.5 kg), easy-to-carry and comes with a protective sleeve.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The IMPALA software provides a central patient overview, insights into the health status of patients and decision support. It integrates up to 20 continuously monitored patients in one central overview. With easy-to-understand patient information records vital signs can be followed in time to detect changes and assess if a patient is improving or deteriorating. With intuitive visual representations of patient health status (called patient avatars), historical patient data and visual warning signs, the IMPALA Application supports (inexperienced and less well-trained) health workers in prioritizing patients with critical needs. </p>
<p>The software is expanded with clinical decision support tools. The first clinical decision support tools consist of rule-based decision trees based on officially recognized guidelines for pediatric and neonatal care that enable less well-trained health staff to provide the first emergency care and notify the doctor/specialists when needed. The development of these solutions is done in a stepwise manner in close collaboration with the key stakeholders. The first decision support tool that is currently being implemented is the Pediatric Early Warning Score. At a later stage we will integrate more complex decision support applications such as the “Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses”. Combined with the other data, these tools create a data-pipeline of high quality and well structured clinical, demographic and vital signs data in time series that will enable development of new decision support tools and algorithms over time.</p>
<p>Our ultimate aim is to have integrated predictive models for various populations to a) provide improved risk stratification and b) to predict acute worsening health episodes, allowing health workers to intervene early on in the process of deteriorating health by patients, which will increase survival rates and reduce (child) mortality.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>In our current proposition we mainly focus on hospitalized children and neonates with high risk conditions in need of continuous monitoring. Additionally we support the HCWs delivering this care. However, by driving innovation in our IMPALA system we want to make it suitable for other populations. For example by developing spot check functionality we want to make it suitable for lower risk patients, enabling improved monitoring for all admitted patients. In addition we aim to develop risk assessment models to identify and monitor vulnerable populations better. </p>
<p>For example by integrating HIV, gender and/or social characteristics in these models. Collecting this kind of information in our models will allow us to detect and monitor health inequalities when applying IMPALA in different situations. This data will then again allow us to adjust the models based on real-life data. Last but not least we want to increase (financial) accessibility and therefore scale and impact by 1) reducing costs related to hardware through innovation and integration of third party solutions 2) providing flexible business models 3) innovating technology to make it more accessible in remote and under-equipped areas by enabling remote care as well as advanced decision support tools which allows use in environments without a doctor. This will allow us to reach underserved populations and reduce health inequalities. </p>","<p>My name is Niek Versteegde MD. MSc.

<ul><li><p>Firstly we use a technologically enabled approach to mitigate the human resources gap by a) facilitating task redistribution b) reducing (cognitive) effort needed for patient management c) reducing workload by enabling reduced admissions and early discharge.

With regards to existing monitoring systems, IMPALA differs from the high-end patient monitoring systems offered by large global companies such as Phillips, GE and Welch Allyn, because it is tailor-made for the low resource context. While offering high quality, these high-end monitors are not suited for these contexts due to high costs, fragility, complexity, as well as difficult to use and maintain. In comparison to the low-end patient monitoring systems by manufacturers predominantly from Asia (e.g. Contec, Narang Medical and Biolight), the IMPALA solution is more user-friendly and durable. Partial solutions and nichemonitors designed for LMICs developed by non-profit organizations (e.g. LifeBox) are durable and affordable but offer limited functionality and do not address relevant needs in high care and intensive care units. Finally the new innovations in vital signs monitoring through wearables (like NeoPenda) provide more real-time information and are easily adaptable to a low resource setting, however, in comparison to IMPALA lack a bed-side screen decision-support, algorithms for interpreting the data and a user interface designed for hospitals in LMIC. These properties make it unsuitable for monitoring in critical care settings. Additionally it is only intended for use in neonates and not other age groups. </p>","<p>The overall aim of the IMPALA solution is to save lives, costs and effort by facilitating a transition from reactive to proactive care in environments with constraints in resources. Although it is difficult to quantify the exact impact as this still has to be proven from ongoing research, we estimate based on literature that mortality can be reduced by 10-30%. In an PICU/NICU with 500 admissions and a 12,5% mortality this would save 6-19 lives per year. In addition we expect that admission time/total number of admission-days can be reduced by 10-30% as well by enabling early discharge and reducing readmissions. Based on an average admission time of 7 days this would save 350-1050 admission days. This of course would reduce the pressure on the healthcare system, the health workers as well as the patients and their caregivers who currently are often exposed to catastrophic healthcare expenditure. The societal gain from these two factors combined will be significant but are not yet taken into account. </p>
<p>An important advantage of the IMPALA system not yet taken into account in the impact calculations, is that the generated data can be leveraged in improving quality of care, assessing care implementation, effectiveness of new interventions and compliance to guidelines. The generated data can also be leveraged for  research purposes or health system management. Last but not least, it can be an enormous accelerator for development and deployment of new digital applications, algorithms and other decision support tools as the time, risks and costs associated with development and scaling up of such interventions can be dramatically reduced. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the tabel below we have written out what our projected growth path is for scaling up our intervention and the anticipated impact we will have. </p>
<figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/60468_blob_1440x810.60468_blob"" alt=""60468_blob_1440x810.60468_blob"" /></figure><p><br /></p>","1. No Poverty, 3. Good Health and Well-being, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 17. Partnerships for the Goals","<p>At the heart of our approach is that data from routine systems are used to guide and monitor implementation, facilitate quality improvement and continuously assess impact on quality of care as well as key process and outcome indicators to follow progress over time.</p>
<p><strong>Using real-life data to guide and monitor implementation and user adoption </strong></p>
<p>The IMPALA system automatically stores data and meta-data relating to the use of the system. E.g. the number of patients, duration of monitoring, duration of alarms, response-time to alarms, alarms settings, up-time, bed occupancy rate and numerous other data points are automatically stored when using the system. These data can be used to assess system usage and responsiveness of health workers to alarms in addition to other factors. These data are used to guide implementation in the initial phase and thereafter to assess if usage is improving/reduced and/or if there are specific challenges in using the system (e.g. differences during nights and weekends vs daytime). These data will be fed back to the users and managers to detect and address potential bottlenecks towards adequate use of the system. IMPALA can also be used to collect data on other interventions (e.g. CPAP in neonates) and assess a) if it is used and b) the fidelity to guidelines if it is applied adequately. </p>
<p><strong>Using real-life data for quality improvement and impact evaluation</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the data mentioned above the IMPALA system also collects data on clinical parameters (e.g. average temperature of neonates throughout admission). Although currently the data entry is limited to vital signs, other inputs will be added soon to further support health workers in their work. These data will be complemented with outcome data and data from routine systems to monitor quality of care and support a process of continuous improvement. This will increase the impact of the intervention over time.</p>
<p>More details about the data we expect to collect can be found in the table below:</p>

<p><br /></p>","<p>In the current situation there are insufficient health workers and they do not have the right training to monitor and manage their patients adequately. This causes a reactive way of patient management in which critical deterioration is detected only at a very late stage and treatments are more costly and less effective. Simultaneously discharge only happens when it is very clear that the patient has recovered, contributing to long admission times. Exposing patients and caregivers to risks and costs associated with admission for longer than needed.</p><p>The overall aim of the IMPALA solution is to save lives, costs and effort by facilitating a transition from reactive to proactive care in environments with constraints in resources.<br /></p><p>This is achieved by </p><p>a)Facilitating systematic collection of high quality data with less effort </p><p>b)organizing and visualizing data more effectively facilitating faster and easier interpretation </p><p>c)providing decision support to health workers </p><p>d)provide tailored capacity building/training together with local partners. </p><p>Combined this approach leads to improved insight, oversight and follow-up of patients which allows for early detection of change and improved and more timely decision making and management of patient. This will contribute to saving lives and costs as each hour delay in treatment increases mortality rate by 10% </p>
<p>In addition to that we expect that there will be a significant reduction of (cognitive) workload for health workers in this setting, especially for nurses but also for doctors. We expect that by improving the working conditions of hospital staff, in the longer term IMPALA implementation will lead to increased job satisfaction and lower staff turnover. </p>
<ol><li><p>By automating data collection through continuous monitoring approximately 5 minutes per vital signs check can be saved. In an average intensive/high care setting, vital signs are checked at a minimum of 6 times per day, reaching as high as hourly measurements. Per patient the time can easily add up to an average of 1hr per day, which would save 1 hour saved * 500 admissions *7 admission days = 3500hr per year equivalent to 2 fte of health workers per year. Of course this will mainly have an impact on quality of care of nurses in overstrained environment </p></li><li><p>Because the IMPALA system systematically collects and organizes the information real-time in the application in an intuitive way, it facilitates improved interpretation of essential information. This makes it easier and less time consuming to assess one or multiple patients. This will also facilitate task redistribution to lower qualified staff and free up time for direct care provision. </p></li></ol><p>The improved balance in workload will likely lead to a direct benefit for patients as scarce time and resources can now be concentrated on those who need it most. This provision of care is supported by real-time information about the condition of patients which can now be more easily observed and responded to in time in case of deterioration. This is further stimulated by providing decision support tools that help health workers to take the right evidence based action at the right moment. </p>","<p><strong>Background: </strong><br /></p>
<p>Monitoring in itself is not lifesaving, however it is aimed at timely detection of a critical condition and should lead to early and effective action by health workers. We conceptualised this process into a model called the monitoring cascade (Attachment I; Figure 1). This model maps out the clinical care process and helps understand what steps are needed before successful and timely intervention can be done. Moreover it helps to identify gaps in this process and combined with qualitative interviews improve understanding of why these gaps exist. We used the model to adjust the system design, enabling us to address potential bottlenecks in the care process, guiding the baseline assessment and tailoring the implementation to a specific hospital context.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>The technology</strong></p>
<p>The IMPALA solution has been iteratively designed, developed and improved over the course of the last 4 years in close collaboration with end-users and biomedical technicians from the target context. The IMPALA system is in the core a software platform for decision support and data-driven services.  Although the IMPALA monitoring device is currently an essential component, we anticipate that in the future it will be replaced by 3rd party monitoring equipment. Through continuous innovation and by leveraging existing solutions, we aim to increase both the relative impact as well as the accessibility of our interventions. In 3-4 years from now we also expect to provide standalone decision support applications that do not require any specific hardware (e.g. for antenatal care or triage). </p>
<p><strong>The IMPALA solution:</strong> a comprehensive approach that combines medical technology, software, training and data-driven services in one package that can be tailored to various contexts. At the heart of this approach is the <strong>IMPALA system</strong>: a combination of the <strong>IMPALA monitoring device</strong> for vital signs monitor which is wirelessly connected to the <strong>IMPALA software</strong> that enables health workers to manage and monitor their patients better in a resource constrained environment. This allows them to allocate scarce time and resources more effectively and intervene at an early stage when treatments are more effective and low-cost. In addition, it reduces pressure on health workers by reducing workload associated with monitoring and facilitating task redistribution. By providing the IMPALA system in a service model providing installation and implementation tailored to the context with local implementing partners, we ensure the system fits the needs of the health workers and provides sustainable high value impact. We increase the value of our IMPALA solution, by providing updates of the software and data-driven services guiding health care implementation and quality improvement. </p>
<p><strong>The IMPALA monitoring device:</strong> is a multiparameter patient monitor with an intuitive touchscreen  that has ECG, pulse-oximeter, non-invasive Blood Pressure (NiBP), and 2 temperature probes. It continuously measures a variety of vital signs: Heart Rate (HR), Pulse rate (PR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), Respiratory rate (RR), systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure and temperature (TEMP). The system is designed in Malawi and Rwanda with African health workers and biomedical technicians making it intuitive, easy to use and ensuring it is resistant to heat, water, dust (IPX 2 rated) and insects. It has an extended battery life of 6 hours and is designed for portability as it is lightweight (weighs &lt;2.5 kg), easy to carry and comes with a protective sleeve. </p>
<p><strong>The IMPALA software </strong>consists of two main components: the IMPALA server and the IMPALA application that work together seamlessly to serve the needs of the HCW. <strong>The IMPALA server</strong> is the central on-premise communication and data-storage hub that wirelessly connects up to 20 monitoring devices with the IMPALA Application. Although internet connection is possible this is not required. All patient data is stored in an electronic patient record for each unique patient, which allows HCW to follow patients over time and detect trends. The usage data, clinical data and process data are automatically stored on the server. All data can be used on an individual or aggregate level for a variety of purposes including quality improvement, scientific research and health system management. </p>
<p><strong>The IMPALA Application</strong> retrieves the information through the server and is the central interface for doctors and nurses. It provides a central patient overview, insights into the health status of patients and decision support. It integrates up to 20 continuously monitored patients in one central monitoring overview. With easy-to-understand patient information records vital signs can be followed in time to detect changes and assess if a patient is improving or deteriorating. With intuitive visual representations of patient health status (called patient avatars), historical patient data and visual warning signs, the IMPALA Application supports (inexperienced and less well-trained) health workers in prioritizing patients with critical needs.  </p>
<p><strong>IMPALA as a platform for decision support:</strong> To further support health workers in their responsibilities GOAL 3 is expanding the software with clinical decision support tools. The first clinical decision support tools consist of rule-based decision trees based on officially recognised guidelines for paediatric and neonatal care. The clinician will make the final decision, however, the decision support can enable less well-trained health staff to provide the first emergency care and notify the doctor/specialists when needed. The development of these solutions are done in a stepwise manner in close collaboration with the key stakeholders. The first decision support tool that is currently under development is the Pediatric Early Warning Score. At a later stage we will integrate more complex decision support applications such as the “Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses” and the “Emergency Triage and Assessment Tool” developed by the WHO. Combined with the other data entered into the IMPALA system, these tools create a data-pipeline of high quality and well structured clinical, demographic and vital signs data in time series that will enable development of new decision support tools and algorithms over time. </p>

It uses off-the-shelf hardware components which were adopted to the specific context of hospitals in a low resource setting. The essence of our innovation lies mostly in integrating the various components into one complete solution and ensuring that it is sustainable, accessible and easy-to-use. The complete system as described in the previous section was iteratively developed and tested in Malawi in two clinical studies (EdoScic pilot in 50 patients and IMPALA cohort 1000 patients) and has proven to function stably and serve the needs of end-users as well as research purposes in these settings. The IMPALA system is currently being used in a Malawian setting and is approved by the ministry of health of Malawi for commercial use. A request for regulatory approval is submitted in Rwanda. The complete IMPALA solution including services is delivered in the St. Luke’s hospital in Malawi where successful user-adoption as well as a positive impact on quality of care is observed which is closely aligned with the preliminary results from the IMPALA project. The IMPALA solution and the associated business models still have to be validated at scale.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>",A new business model or process that relies on technology to be successful,,"Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, Biotechnology / Bioengineering, Internet of Things, Manufacturing Technology, Software and Mobile Applications","Malawi,Rwanda","Malawi,Rwanda,Tanzania",Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit,,"Full time (32 hours or more) 14, parttime 4",Bart Bierling started developing the IMPALA system as part of his study industrial design 6 years ago. Since 4 years GOAL 3 was officially started by its founders.,"<p>Inclusive design is part and parcel of the approach we take as GOAL 3.  The IMPALA solution has been iteratively designed, developed and improved over the course of the last 4 years in close collaboration with end-users and biomedical technicians from the target context. Dozens of user interviews, cognitive walkthroughs and heuristic interviews with end-users were done during this process. Throughout there have been close interactions with other key stakeholders from the ministry of health, iNGOs and managerial functions at the nursing, hospital and regional levels.  In this period a clinical pilot was done (EdOSciC) evaluating the conceptual models as well as the IMPALA solution. Based on these inputs plus the combined experience of the GOAL 3 and IMPALA project team we developed several conceptual models analyzing the current challenges in emergency and critical care services in low-resource-settings, while improving our understanding of what was needed to address this challenge. </p>
<p><strong>2. Setting up the IMPALA consortium: </strong>The pilot also made us realise that for successfully designing and applying a monitor in  a LRS we would require a broader expertise. We formed an international multidisciplinary consortium with experts in the field of critical care, social sciences, artificial intelligence, e-health and Point of Care laboratory diagnostics. This consortium consists of 3 Malawian partners (TRUE, KUHeS, MUBAS), 3 Dutch partners (AIGHD, NeLL, GOAL3) and 1 British partner (Imperial College London) each bringing their own expertise. In this consortium we tried to match experts in Europe and Malawi to work on projects to share knowledge in both directions. The EDCTP funding opportunity boosted the formation of the consortium and consecutive studies and monitor development.<br /></p>
<p><strong>3. IMPALA clinical cohort: </strong>The main aim of the current stage of the IMPALA project is to further develop the IMPALA monitoring system to feature predictive algorithms based on vital signs, sociodemographic data and biomarkers for early prediction of critical illness in children in LRS. This project was started in May 2021 and consists of three stages (Attachment I, Figure 3). In the first stage the feedback from the pilot study using IMPALA 1.0 was used to develop an upgraded monitoring device (IMPALA 2.0), to perform a baseline clinical assessment prior to implementation and design and prepare the clinical studies. In the second stage IMPALA 2.0 was implemented, evaluated and data gathered for training and validation of the predictive algorithms for critical illness. The iterative design and usability allows improvements of the monitor. In the third phase IMPALA 3.0 will be developed through integration of the predictive algorithms and the final User Interface  and hardware design. IMPALA 3.0 will then be evaluated in a mixed-methods pilot study to test the performance in terms of critical illness <em>prediction</em> and impact on clinical decision making. </p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>GOAL 3 sees itself mainly as a software, data and platform company that offers software to enable data-driven decision making at the various levels of national and international health system. In our current go-to-market and scaling strategy we aim to provide a complete solution with a) High quality fit for context and intuitive monitoring equipment at affordable costs b) clinical information and decision support software to improve patient management and provide quality improvement and ensure that this tailored to the local context with local implementing partners. In this model we aim to have a very compelling offering by providing hardware at low costs and software as a subscription model in which updates and upgrades are included in the subscription fee. We anticipate that we will sell hardware at or below costs and that our margins will come predominantly from the software subscriptions.</p>
<p>This translates to a business model in which the monitoring equipment and other hardware is sold at cost price (approximately 1000$ per device) and that over years the revenue is made based on the software and service model (1$ per device per year) </p>
<p>In this approach we distinguish the following sales channels:</p>
<p>1) Direct sales to hospitals </p>
<p>2) Indirect sales to hospitals with a 3rd party funder</p>
<p>3) Sales to iNGO's / through implementing partners</p>
<p>4) governmental sales. </p>
<p>On the short term we expect that 2 &amp; 3 will be our main drivers of growth until we reach the point where we can clearly demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and other benefits of the intervention. After that we expect 1 and 4 will increasingly become drivers of growth.</p>",Organizations (B2B),"<p>As a social enterprise GOAL 3 aims to become self-sustainable based on revenue generated through sales as explained in the previous section.

This solution targets critical issues in healthcare systems across African countries, such as inadequate performance, a severe shortage of health workers, and the high mortality rates of pediatric and neonatal patients. It offers a comprehensive clinical support system tailored for emergency and critical care in resource-limited settings, combining intuitive software and durable hardware designed for the African healthcare environment.

GOAL 3's IMPALA monitors vital signs through a multiparameter device and supports healthcare workers (HCWs) with a software application for patient management and decision support. The hardware component is uniquely designed to be robust and user-friendly, addressing common challenges like high temperatures, dust, and heavy usage in low-resource settings. The software component provides a central patient overview, insights into patient health status, and tools for clinical decision support based on recognized care guidelines.

The primary beneficiaries are hospitalized children and neonates at high risk, alongside HCWs managing their care. The solution not only aims to detect and manage critical conditions early to save lives and reduce costs but also seeks to support HCWs under high workloads with limited resources. GOAL 3's future objectives include making the IMPALA system suitable for a broader range of patients and adapting it for use in even more resource-constrained environments.

The team, led by CEO Niek Versteegde, combines expertise in medicine, global health, industrial design, and clinical epidemiology, highlighting their capacity to deliver this solution. GOAL 3 is in the Pilot stage, with the IMPALA system currently operational in three hospitals in Malawi, monitoring around 800 patients so far.

GOAL 3's solution aligns with several UN Sustainable Development Goals, including Good Health and Well-being, No Poverty, Reduced Inequalities, and Partnerships for the Goals. Their business model relies on selling hardware at or below cost and generating revenue through software subscriptions, aiming for financial sustainability by scaling to a target of 2,500 devices installed. To date, GOAL 3 has raised €3M through a mix of grants, investments, and loans, and is working towards its first sales, anticipated in the near future."

Children living with disability have a long term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairment that hinders their participation in the society. They live in every community, they are born with or acquire distinct impairments which in relation to their surroundings lead to functional difficulties such as seeing, walking, hearing, communicating, caring for oneself or making friends. 
  </p>
<p>The extent to which these children function, participate in the community and lead fulfilling lives depends on the extent to which they are accommodated and included. They are faced with a range of barriers that limits their ability to function in daily life, access social services (education and health care) and engage in their communities. Some of the most common challenges include accessibility in physical environments and on the internet, social exclusion, absence of assistive technology and barriers in health care.</p>
<p>These include:
  </p>
<p>Physical barriers – buildings, transportation, toilets, playgrounds that can’t be accessed by wheelchair users. 
  </p>

75205,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Finalist,"Biospectal OptiBP uses optical algorithms on smartphones – transforming your device into an easy-to-use, accurate blood pressure monitor to manage hypertension, the silent killer and number one chronic health condition worldwide.","<p>In fragile settings like the informal settlements of Nairobi, Kenya, access to routine blood pressure screenings and monitoring is often unavailable due to the cost of traditional blood pressure cuffs, patient access to clinics, and difficulty connecting blood pressure data to clinics remotely. OptiBP solves this problem by transforming the ubiquitous smartphone camera into a connected medical-grade blood pressure monitoring device.</p>
<p>Non-communicable diseases like hypertension account for more than a third of deaths in Kenya, with similar rates across sub-Saharan Africa. The leading cause of heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa is hypertension, while the diagnosis rate remains less than 40%.</p>
<p>In Kenya, approximately 60% of families live in areas defined as urban slums or informal settlements. Ethnographic research conducted on hypertension monitoring in these settlements revealed that they suffer from significantly limited access to clinics. Due to the shortage of clinical resources needed to measure blood pressure, monitoring patient blood pressure after initial diagnosis presents a serious challenge and has a significant impact on managing the disease. Especially in these low income, fragile settings, people lack access to necessary healthcare, while simultaneously, community health workers struggle with traditional clinical models to increase local capacity to treat chronic diseases like hypertension. They simply do not have the resources to follow up with patients out in the community and to capture and manage blood pressure data for effective diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Hypertension is not only the number one chronic condition in Kenya. It is the number one chronic disease worldwide, affecting 1.3 billion adults – 30% of the adult population. Moreover, two-thirds of this population live in low-middle income countries. Hypertension poses a severe public health threat to life and longevity, increasing the risk of premature death by 2X and the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease by 3x. </p>
<p>Traditionally, the cuff method of measuring and tracking blood pressure has been woefully lacking. The cuff is often difficult to get in fragile settings and is bulky, inconvenient, and uncomfortable. It also doesn’t connect to patient record systems, requiring tedious manual data logging and analysis. As a result, tracking hypertension has been a critical failure point in effective management. OptiBP solves this two-fold problem by making the capture of blood pressure easy and convenient at the fingertip and then seamlessly connecting that information with clinicians for better treatment.</p>
<p>Hypertension screening and monitoring constitute a significant gap in fragile population health systems due to access and adherence to measurement protocols. Data collection and analysis are currently inefficient for health workers and their patients. Implementing the OptiBP solution in the Kibera settlement in Nairobi solves this problem of reliable access to hypertension monitoring and management by using smartphones that already exist in the hands of patients and community health workers.</p>","<p>Biospectal’s patented OptiBP software uses AI and machine learning to enable a transformation in access and actionability for capturing and managing blood pressure information. By turning smartphones into blood pressure monitoring devices, OptiBP contributes to building resilient health systems by dramatically increasing health worker effectiveness and capacity, and by engaging the ubiquity and connectivity of smartphones, amplifies access and quality of blood pressure monitoring and management among fragile communities. OptiBP provides an easy, effective tool for health workers and engages patients to take their own blood pressure via fingertip on their own phones. This decreases the burden on the health system and allows for effective anytime, anywhere monitoring without the need for direct health worker intervention.</p>
<p>OptiBP enables medical-grade blood pressure monitoring in existing smartphones by simply installing an app and placing a fingertip on the camera— without needing another wearable device or additional bulky hardware. The health workforce can repurpose their existing smartphones to measure blood pressure and ensure routine screenings are a regular part of primary care services. OptiBP integrates monitoring data with patient record systems and clinical management for clinical decision support.</p>
<p>By providing tools the community health workforce needs to screen and monitor population-level hypertension, governments, and health systems can make more effective and efficient interventions knowing the communities’ disease burden, while also enabling the continuity of care for chronic disease.</p>
<p>OptiBP also improves the accessibility and quality of health services to women and children by providing a<a href=""https://twitter.com/hrpresearch/status/1649381706451894277?s=48&amp;t=pKmSq3x7cuz3IyumkWajFg""> tool to measure maternal hypertension</a>. Hypertension diseases of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Blood pressure monitoring is an essential recommendation from<a href=""https://anc.srhr.org/#Tools""> WHO’s Digital Antenatal Care module</a> for improving pregnancy outcomes in LMICs.</p>
<p>As part of our mission to develop scalable software solutions that improve hypertension management globally, we have forged a foundational partnership with <a href=""https://amref.org/"">Amref Health Africa</a>, the largest health NGO in Africa, which will be the first initiative to be fully managed by the Biospectal team. This project extends our prior work with the WHO and is a model for strengthening fragile health systems across the world.</p>","<p>Amref Health Africa, Biospectal, and the Kenya Ministry of Health jointly propose to launch a mobile remote patient monitoring (MRPM) model for hypertension within Kenya's informal settlements, starting in Kibera, the largest informal settlement in Africa. MPRM increases local capacity and resilience in managing chronic disease and empowers community health workers to use technology to deliver primary care services better.</p>
<p>Biospectal's OptiBP platform is an ideal hypertension screening and management solution among fragile populations, where access to clinical facilities and using blood pressure cuffs are inconvenient and poses barriers to frequent measurement necessary for effective clinical treatment. Access to clinics is difficult; we democratize clinical monitoring at the ""point of patient"" in easy-to-use devices already in patient and health worker pockets everywhere. Smartphone blood pressure tracking is more cost-effective, more convenient, and quickly captures measurements to guide patients’ next steps in their own health management.

OptiBP replaces the antiquated traditional blood pressure cuff while providing medical-grade blood pressure measurement and management anytime and anywhere with a device already in the hands of patients. In fragile health settings, wearable devices and even traditional blood pressure cuffs are not feasible to procure nor are they sustainable to maintain. In Kenya, with over 90% of the population owning a phone, the barrier to blood pressure monitoring would be completely eliminated. Hypertensive patients can now contribute to and be involved in their health outcomes in a way that hasn't existed. Without the innovation of OptiBP, hypertension would remain largely undiagnosed and poorly managed.</p>
<p>New devices, apps, and platforms allow patients to participate much more in their healthcare. The new distributed healthcare model fundamentally shifts from static to one where each patient is a stakeholder and a collaborator in their care. Active investment in an individual's health leads to better outcomes. This type of available technology helps the health workforce to better understand each patient's health and put together a road map to vitality by accumulating a volume of data unique to each patient. Health systems can view a patient's overall health not just once but over many years. The result is a comprehensive look at a patient's–and population’s health from a holistic perspective rather than the often-inaccurate snapshot from a single clinic or home visit. Ultimately, technology and platforms like OptiBP will allow patients to participate at the highest possible level in managing their health to a new degree and improving health outcomes.</p>","<p><strong>1. Improve health outcomes – via improved user adherence and integration of connected data to clinicians</strong>.</p>
<p>We plan to integrate the OptiBP mobile application within electronic health record (EHR) systems used by healthcare providers and governments to enable data sharing between patients and clinicians. This will give clinicians real-time access to patient data, allowing them to make more informed decisions and provide better care, and help build a country profile of hypertension.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Reduce cost &amp; Improve BP monitoring adherence – via ultra-scalable, efficient cloud distribution to the already existing global installed smartphone user base.</strong></p>
<p>Providing OptiBP for community-driven solutions eliminates the need for providing blood pressure cuffs in fragile health systems.

<p>OptiBP proprietary pulse wave analysis (PWA) algorithm transforms photoplethysmographic (PPG) wave information into blood pressure values by optically measuring blood flow through the skin. OptiBP technology is based on more than 10 years of R&amp;D effort and was initially developed for the continuous monitoring of BP on anesthetized patients by means of optical sensors placed at the fingertip.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/59913_Figure%201_1440x810.png"" alt=""59913_Figure%201_1440x810.png"" /></figure><p><em>Figure 1: To use OptiBP, the user covers the smartphone camera with the fingertip after initiating a recording with the app.</em><br /></p>
<p>OptiBP has been developed and ported into a mobile application on everyday smartphones (Figure 1). Our Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) utilizes the smartphone's camera to record the capillary blood flow beneath the fingertip's skin (Figure 2). The external visible light enhanced by camera flash illumination passes through the fingertip's skin. This light reflects off blood flowing through vessels in the finger. The volumetric variation of blood in the fingertip changes the light absorption, and the camera's RGB sensor registers such variation. The resulting image data changes based on the saturation increase and decrease as waves of blood pass through. The smartphone camera sensor then captures this reflected light and associated image variation. This technique creates what we call a photoplethysmographic (PPG) wave signal.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/59909_Figure%202_1440x810.png"" alt=""Figure 2"" /></figure><p><br /></p>
<p><em>Figure 2: OptiBP utilizes image data generated from volumetric blood flow changes via light passing through the fingertip, reflecting off of blood flowing through the vessels, and then passing to the phone camera's image sensor.</em></p>
<p>Pulse wave analysis (PWA) is the study of the morphology of the pulse pressure waveform to obtain information about the state of ventricular ejection and the (elastic and geometric) properties of the arterial tree. When blood is being ejected from the heart, a blood pressure wave is generated and travels along the walls of the arterial tree (Figure 3). This pressure wave is partly reflected at each arterial bifurcation or discontinuity due to the mismatch of hydraulic impedance. These reflected waves travel back to the heart. The resulting aortic pressure waveform is thus a superposition of the forward wave traveling from the heart towards the periphery and a global reflected wave traveling back to the heart. One of the first and most marked reflections in the arterial pathway of the blood pressure wave traveling from the heart occurs at the aortic bifurcation, where the aorta forks into the left and right common iliac arteries. As such, the onset of the reflected wave marks the reflected wave transit time from the aortic valve to the aortic bifurcation and back. This time is proportional to the central pulse wave velocity (PWV), a well-established indicator of central blood pressure.</p>

Two reflection sites, one at the height of the renal arteries, the other one in the vicinity of the iliac bifurcation, give rise to the reflected pulses (P2, P3) that trail the primary left ventricular ejection (P1).</em></p>
<p>OptiBP includes various processing steps to measure blood pressure (see Figure 4). The processing starts with the camera initialization and monitoring video quality during the recording, followed by the computation of a “raw” or uncalibrated blood pressure estimate based on the analysis of the recorded pulse wave PPG signal, and followed finally by the absolute blood pressure estimate that takes the raw blood pressure and adds an appropriate offset that is specific to the user. The OptiBP offset utilizes the periodic calibration to a blood pressure cuff and user demographics. </p>

<p>Biospectal’s software-only approach enables the embodiment of the Biospectal OptiBP technology in a myriad of optical devices, starting with smartphone cameras that exist in pockets everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>OptiBP app doesn’t require a high-end smartphone; it works on phones of all price levels and uses the built-in camera to monitor, record and measure a user’s blood flow via their fingertip quickly and easily. A measurement is rendered in approximately 20 seconds — half the time of a typical blood pressure cuff. OptiBP’s proprietary algorithms and optical signal capture methods transform the captured data into blood pressure values. </p>
<p>A large-scale, third-party clinical research study published in October 2020 by <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74955-4"">Scientific Reports in Nature</a> validated the ability of the Biospectal OptiBP smartphone app to measure blood pressure accurately utilizing transdermal optical sensing and a smartphone camera lens.

This solution specifically targets hypertension, identified as a major health challenge in fragile settings such as Nairobi, Kenya's informal settlements, where traditional blood pressure monitoring methods face limitations due to cost, accessibility, and logistical issues. OptiBP intends to democratize blood pressure monitoring by leveraging the widespread ownership of smartphones to overcome these barriers, offering an easy-to-use tool for both health workers and patients and integrating the collected data seamlessly with clinics for improved management of hypertension.

The solution is at the pilot stage of development, characterized by ongoing OptiBP public beta programs and clinical validation studies involving over 300 active users in diverse geographical settings (Tanzania, South Africa, and Bangladesh), demonstrating the app's accuracy and effectiveness in blood pressure measurement. Additionally, a partnership with Amref Health Africa signifies a strategic approach to piloting OptiBP in Kibera, Nairobi, with the project aimed at demonstrating the feasibility and scalability of the solution in a real-world, fragile setting.

The solution serves communities in fragile settings, integrating with existing health systems to enhance the capability of health workers, engage patients in self-monitoring, and provide critical data for healthcare intervention planning. The partnership for this solution includes Amref Health Africa and the Kenya Ministry of Health, intending to kickstart a mobile remote patient monitoring model for hypertension within Kenya’s informal settlements.

The team behind OptiBP, headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, with members in Boston and Silicon Valley, is composed of experienced professionals across medical research and development, global health, and product innovation. Their extensive background, combined with foundational partnerships like that with Amref Health Africa, positions them to effectively address the challenge of hypertension monitoring and management in low-resource settings.

This solution primarily provides services to organizations, adopting a business model that spans direct consumer access through mobile app stores and integration with healthcare delivery systems, considering the flexibility in licensing pricing in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) to ensure access. The financial sustainability plan encompasses a mix of subsidy/reimbursement, direct-to-consumer subscriptions, business-to-business licensing, and collaboration with non-profits for funding research and implementation in underserved communities.

Impact goals for the next one to five years include improving health outcomes through enhanced adherence to blood pressure monitoring, reducing costs, and creating a global picture of hypertension management through scalable cloud distribution and large-scale data analytics. Their progress toward these goals is measured by ongoing and planned clinical research and validation studies, regulatory approvals, and developing go-to-market strategies for both LMICs and high-income countries."
75300,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Semi-Finalist,"Leverage AI/ML models to improve the data collection, quality of care, and doctor - patient consultations on eSanjeevani - the Government of India's telemedicine platform.","<p>As per WHO 2022 data, India was at 0.7 medical doctors per 1,000 population, besides facing a shortage of trained manpower of nurses and pharmacists in the health system. To address this gap and provide an alternative to conventional physical consultations, the Ministry of Health and Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, introduced the telemedicine platform ""eSanjeevani"", which facilitates remote consultations. </p>
<p>The eSanjeevani platform has enabled two types of telemedicine services — doctor-to-doctor (eSanjeevani) and patient-to-doctor (eSanjeevani OPD) teleconsultations. The former is being implemented under the Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centre (HWC). There are over 50,000 operational AB-HWCs in the country. Patients use eSanjeevani by logging in, using a smartphone or web-based application, for general or specialized OPD consultations from enlisted medical institutions and doctors. They can also access eSanjeevani at public HWCs across the country. <br />The platform facilitates 0.2-0.25 million consultations in a day. We analyzed data from over 60 million consultations conducted on it and found several challenges, such as inaccurate and unstandardized recording of patient symptoms, use of free-text fields, lack of screening tools, incorrect OPD recommendations, limited application of standard treatment protocols, and high patient load. These factors relate to multiple challenges in accurate diagnosis, adherence to standard treatment guidelines, treatment regimens, and quality of treatment. </p>
<p>The Government of India has included eSanjeevani in IndiaStack, a global digital public good platform, to offer the telemedicine platform to other countries as part of India’s G20 Presidency. Given the scale of the platform, it has the potential to transform primary health care for underserved communities across borders. </p>","<p>Our goal is to leverage AI/ML as a comprehensive clinical decision support system to improve the quality of care and features of the eSanjeevani telemedicine platform. We have a partnership with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India, that provides us unique access to the eSanjeevani development environment and mandate to improve it.</p>
<p>To start with<em>, </em>we have developed, integrated, and deployed a SMART Interactive Patient Form (SIPF) into eSanjeevani. The SIPF uses a rule-based logical workflow to enable the accurate collection of chief complaints by engaging patients with relevant questions. It enables structured and efficient collection of necessary patient symptom details, shows patient symptom summaries, connects the patient with the appropriate remote healthcare provider, and facilitates automated recommendations of differential diagnoses to the attending physician. The form is currently available in 13 languages and covers 115 symptoms (and 31 diseases). </p>
<p>We aim to expand this symptom repository, encompassing over 1000 clinical symptoms (covering 100+ diseases). We aim to develop, integrate and deploy AI/ML models for image-based screening for various conditions such as those related to dermatology. We aim to expand functions of the form to include diagnostic assistance, treatment regimen assistance, treatment adherence assistance, and morbidity risk profiling. At the same time, we are exploring LLM (Large Language Model)</p>
<p>based use cases to improve documentation of notes, and turn the conversation between patients and doctors into electronic health records by extracting information through multimodal inputs.

This has the potential to change the market by catalyzing other players in the space (especially other LMICs) to innovate and improve their technologies. </p>
<p>Secondly, our solution strengthens the capacity and efficiency of technology platforms already implemented by the Government of India. By integrating AI/ML-driven solutions on top of existing systems, we are making significant improvements in the delivery of healthcare services, particularly in rural and remote areas where access to quality healthcare is limited. This not only benefits patients and healthcare workers but also improves the overall health system by reducing the burden on healthcare workers, optimizing the capacity of doctors, and delivering quality consultations. </p>
<p>Overall, our solution has the potential to create positive impacts that go beyond our immediate impact goals, which can inspire and influence others to make similar efforts.<br /></p>","<ol><li><p>Transform the quality of care across the care chain for the most vulnerable populations in India: Women, children, senior citizens, overburdened health workers, and populations in rural areas are some of the most vulnerable populations due to a range of socio-economic factors. Currently, excessive patient loads and a shortage of infrastructure and manpower prevent these groups, especially from accessing quality care. We plan to transform the end-to-end primary care experience by expanding the functions of the SIPF such as treatment regimen assistance, treatment adherence, morbidity risk profiling, and integrating image-based screening and large language models (LLMs) into future iterations. We will continue to work with various state health departments to deploy our solution across all states in India, improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery to overburdened healthcare workers and healthcare providers.</p></li><li><p>Create a global AI public good: Over the next five years, we plan to further expand our reach and impact globally by sharing our solution as a public good. We aim to make our AI/ML technology accessible to health systems and healthcare providers in LMICs through our open-source approach. We believe that our solution has the potential to create a ripple effect in the healthcare space by catalyzing broader positive impacts from others in this space. By strengthening existing technology platforms with our AI/ML models, we aim to set new benchmarks in global telemedicine technology, improving health outcomes for vulnerable populations.
</p></li><li><p>Improving national datasets: Our solution would lead to spillover benefits by improving the state of health data collection in the country and structuring government datasets. The Smart Form generates structured data that is crucial in monitoring and evaluating health programs, and will also be beneficial for training new AI/ML models. This data is also used to inform policymakers on health system priorities and to allocate resources. The solution could be expanded to generate real-time surveillance data for tracking disease trends, identifying outbreaks, and monitoring the effectiveness of interventions. With the increased adoption of technology-based solutions, this will encourage the government to invest more in digital infrastructure, creating a more efficient and accountable health system. </p></li></ol>",3. Good Health and Well-being,"<p>To measure the extent to which the system has strengthened, we will develop and implement a robust monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) strategy. This will involve conducting a quasi-experimental study and using appropriate metrics for conducting baseline and end-line evaluations with statistically significant sample sizes to understand the quantitative and qualitative impact. Indicators can include the number of SIPFs completed on eSanjeevani, the number of errors in completing the form, the total average time that is taken to fill it, usage (defined by ease of using the solution and number of people using it), and coverage (number of people who have access to the solution, additional health facilities that are leveraging eSanjeevani and the SIPF, etc.). These indicators are examples and will be finalized in consultation with the Ministry of Health. Routine monitoring of data, monthly reviews, quarterly interactions with stakeholders, and regular dip-stick studies will enable us to track progress and identify areas that may require a course correction.

<p>Use of AI-driven solutions on the national telemedicine platform to optimize efficiency and reduce the burden on the health system</p>","<p>The solution involves a combination of expert knowledge and the power of data through AI. It currently has two components - one component elicits the patient health information using an Interactive Form, and is a rule-based model. The rules or the sequence of questions that are being asked in the form come from medical literature and clinical practice. Eg. If someone has a fever, based on clinical practice and medical literature, the patient needs to be asked follow-up questions, such as the duration of the fever, the onset, and other characteristics of the symptoms and associated symptoms. These rules and the questions in the form have been formulated by a group of medical professionals.
This medical information elicited from the patient then is passed on to the ML model, which then uses this information to predict a possible list of diagnoses. There are certain rules embedded into the system as well, to safeguard the patient. This is based on the idea that “no output” is better than a “wrong output”. There is also an expert-in-the-loop in the entire system who needs to verify the model’s output before making a decision.</p>
<p>The current ML model uses patient information/symptoms to convert them into a format that is read by the model, called encodings. This is just a representation of text into words, which is then fed to the ML model, identified as gradient-boosting trees (XGBoost). We are also running some experiments in parallel to use deep learning-based models like Biobert as well as LLMs to improve the diagnosis performance. The current XGBoost model outputs a list of diagnoses (called differential diagnoses) along with their scores. We pick up top-N diagnoses based on the model score and display them in rank order to the expert making the final decision.</p>",A new application of an existing technology,,"Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, Big Data",India,India,Nonprofit,,"Currently, the solutions team includes 53 full-time employees, 05 interns, and 17 consultants","One year, four months","<p>Our organization strongly believes that DEI is an essential part of our mission and approach. We recognize that healthcare disparities exist across diverse populations, and we strive to create an inclusive healthcare environment for everyone. We take several steps to incorporate diversity, equity, and inclusivity into our work:</p>
<p>Firstly, we have made sure that our interactive patient form is available in multiple languages and covers a wide range of symptoms, which helps patients from diverse backgrounds to access healthcare services without any language barriers.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have also made sure that the providers who use our solution are trained on how to work with patients from diverse backgrounds. We provide them with training on the solutions we design and how best to incorporate them into their workflows while accounting for their nascency in using digital solutions to enhance and unburden their workload.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we conduct periodic reviews and assessments to ensure that our solution is achieving its intended outcomes and that we are meeting our diversity, equity, and inclusivity goals. We co-develop all our AI solutions, and program interventions with the communities through a process of iterative prototyping - collecting feedback and incorporating it. Through the co-development process, we hope to build ownership of the project to facilitate sustainability after the grant period. </p>
<p>Fourthly, bias is a common challenge in AI and occurs when aggregate results are not reflected in marginalized or protected cohorts. We have experience in this area from our work on predicting adherence to medication in TB. We will use two broad approaches: collecting representative data that adequately captures protected cohorts, and testing and evaluating the algorithms’ performance at key stages of development and deployment to systematically check for bias. Bias removal will be addressed through both data resampling and algorithmic approaches.</p>
<p>We regularly assess our progress and seek feedback from team members and external partners to ensure that we are continuously improving our efforts toward DEI. </p>","<p>We operate as a non-profit applied AI institute that leverages in-house AI/ML expertise to design solutions primarily for healthcare, education, and agriculture. Our social impact use cases result from landscape analysis, discussions with program partners, and government officials. We rely on grant funding from philanthropic organizations, corporate social responsibility initiatives, and similar sources to sustain our operations. Our approach is program-centric and need-based, and we work closely with partners to identify and address pressing social issues.</p>
<p>A key aspect of our business model is our strong partnerships with the government and other program partners. We collaborate with government bodies to identify use cases that require AI intervention and develop solutions that address the specific needs of the beneficiaries. We develop AI solutions, evaluate them, build capacity for the government, and then transfer them for scaled deployment. For example, we have established an AI-Centre of Excellence (AI-CoE) for health in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The AI-CoE combines applied AI/ML techniques with a program-centric, need-based, and entrepreneurial problem-solving approach to improve existing technology systems' scope and effectiveness. Through this partnership, we are deploying AI/ML models to expand the functionality and capability of three technology platforms under the MoHFW - eSanjeevani (telemedicine), Nikshay (Tuberculosis), and RCH portal (maternal and child health). </p>
<p>Overall, our business model is centered around a mission-driven approach to using AI for social impact. We strive to make our solutions widely accessible, and to that end, we open-source all our products, to turn them into digital public goods to maximize their impact.</p>",Government (B2G),"<p>To achieve financial sustainability, we rely on a combination of funding sources. This includes sustained donations and grants from philanthropies, corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, and government bodies. We have a strong track record of securing grants from leading philanthropic organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, and Google.org, as well as partnerships with government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we plan to leverage our open-source approach to drive sustainability by turning our AI solutions into digital public goods. By doing so, we hope to draw contributions from a wider community of developers and users, which would drive ongoing innovation and impact and bring attention to our work within social impact funding networks. </p>
<p>We are also keeping an eye on new developments in the social impact funding landscape, such as the upcoming social stock exchange (SSE) in India which will be launched by the end of 2023.

The platform plays a crucial role in bridging the gap caused by the shortage of medical doctors in India, which stands at 0.7 per 1,000 population according to WHO 2022 data. Despite facilitating 0.2-0.25 million consultations daily and crossing 100 million beneficiary milestones, the platform faces challenges like unstandardized patient symptom recording, incorrect OPD recommendations, and high patient load.

The proposed solution involves leveraging AI/ML models to develop a comprehensive clinical decision support system for improving data collection, diagnosis accuracy, treatment protocol adherence, and quality of care on eSanjeevani. The initial step of this solution has been the development and deployment of a SMART Interactive Patient Form (SIPF), available in 13 languages, which uses a rule-based logical workflow for accurate symptom collection, directs patients to appropriate healthcare providers, and offers automated differential diagnoses suggestions. Future expansions include broadening the symptom repository, incorporating image-based screening, diagnostic assistance, treatment regimen guidance, and utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) for enhancing documentation processes.

The targeted beneficiaries include vulnerable populations such as women, senior citizens, and individuals in rural areas, particularly from areas with less developed health systems like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The solution aims to unburden healthcare workers by pre-collecting patient information, thereby improving the quality of consultations.

The team behind this solution boasts established partnerships with the government and expertise in developing AI solutions for social impact, alongside a commitment to a human-centered design approach. They operate out of New Delhi, India, and have marked their solution's stage of development as 'Growth', highlighting an established product that is deployed in communities. 

By improving the quality of healthcare delivery and creating a scalable model for digital public health goods, the solution envisions a significant impact on the efficiency and resilience of health systems, particularly in India and potentially in other low and middle-income countries. The team intends to measure their progress using specific indicators like usage rates and feedback from stakeholders to ensure continuous improvement and adherence to their impact goals."
75460,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Semi-Finalist,We reduce the distance between patients and health systems with existing low-cost technologies in remote areas of the Amazon.,"<p>Our project focuses on solving a recurrent problem in one of Latin America’s most fragile regions: the reachability of some patients in the Amazon, where the high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases associated with specific geography, socioeconomic factors, and a river-based transport system—which results in days of travel between cities—creates a very particular and difficult situation. This arrangement creates an enormous gap between patients, who must be followed up, and the health teams that must follow them.</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Cardiovascular diseases are a worldwide problem; hypertension alone affects 1.3 billion people currently. In 2020, the Brazilian Public Health System spent $2 billion in hospitalization and medicines on its 52,4 million hypertensive patients. In this delicate region, this scenario is even worse due to diet and cultural factors, such as the use of salt to keep protein fresh for longer in areas with no electrical power. In this area, where the prevalence of hypertensive men is around 28% and 23% for women, it reaches 67% in the elderly population.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In urban areas, only 40% of these hypertensive patients are currently under control, a number that is likely much worse in isolated areas due to a lack of appropriate diagnoses, treatment, and follow-up. In 2020, 29 million people live in the Brazilian Amazon, with 4 million of those in rural areas, where only 16% have access to the internet at home due to the high cost, difficult installation, and instability.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>This population is remarkably arranged nearby and along the riverbanks during its course, using a sole river-based transportation system. This ""liquid territory"" changes seasonally and makes it even harder to travel during certain periods. Besides this, there is also electrical and connection isolation in the river course, which is only available near larger villages.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>All these factors create a very complex situation, which results in inefficient, expensive, and laborious health assistance with several difficulties for capillarization. The teams, designated by the Ministry of Health and municipalities, spend weeks traveling by ship, going village by village, and trying to examine the largest possible number of patients at a time, since the next time they will return to that region again will be months later. This precious time is mostly used for resolving patient complaints and analyzing basic vital signs to adjust medications.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In emergency scenarios, people are transported thousands of kilometers to big cities with health infrastructure, sometimes taking more than 24 hours. Therefore, most patients do not get timely emergency care. For those who make it, there is an astronomical financial burden —totaling U$ 30.000,00 per person transported in a country with a minimum of U$ 236,00—and the patients are usually in critical condition due to this delay. Many patients die before reaching assistance.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>All factors discussed above affect mortality rates. Research shows these populations have higher mortality rates than those in urban areas. This difference is colossal—sometimes 10 times more—when compared to developed countries. The government has historically tried to figure this problem out with no success.
</p>","<p>In order to solve this multiple-layer problem, our solution also has multiple layers of approaches and makes new use of some existing technologies in an innovative manner, reducing the gap between patients and the health system. To do so, we will work complementarily with local healthcare teams and systems, creating a more efficient way to provide continuous healthcare to this population.</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Our strategy consists of providing families in this area with a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease with a kit that includes three inexpensive and existing sensors (glucometer, sphygmomanometer, and oximeter) at a total cost of $37,50. These sensors are synchronized with the mobile application installed on their cellphones, since most of these families have at least one smartphone to communicate when going to big villages.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>This application is intuitive and developed with the illiterate in mind. It also contains educational content focused on healthy habits, diet (with optional healthy dishes of local cuisine), and avoidance of smoking or drinking to focus not only on the family member that already has a disease but also on lifestyle changes for all the patients, aiming for primary and secondary prevention care.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>It allows families to monitor blood pressure and other parameters without having to annotate, remember, or get lost in the numbers because all the synchronization happens automatically. This data is saved on the patient’s phone and syncs automatically with our platform and become available to health teams responsible for that area. For those in no signal area, a small device (at a cost of $30,00) connects patients with our network.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>This synchronization allows for continuous follow-up, evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment, and feedback using specific channels inside our app with the technology explained below.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>For this continuous data exchange, our solution includes a low-cost long-range (LoRa) decentralized network, where every patient works as a bridge to connect the subsequent ones to the network. This long-range network arrangement allows data to be collected and send using multiple paths, chosen automatically, and provides a constant and robust low-data connection. The distance between these nodes can be as much as hundreds of kilometers, depending on the environment, making them excellent for our approach.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In addition to this robust and continuous but relatively slow connection, there is also a satellite link provided by StarLink antennas installed on the boats that already pass by these families daily, transporting cargo or people between cities. It creates a few minutes of high-speed connection every day that will be used for bigger data transfers, video-based telemedicine, and as a backup path to data synchronization with the health team.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>As explained before, our goal is to optimize the already existing healthcare organization and infrastructure by reducing the well-known gap problem in our region. As an example, there are currently several telemedicine centers that provide healthcare to this population. However, they are very poorly utilized due to the connection problems and the physical distance, which requires several days of travel to reach these patients.
</p>","<p>Our solution serves the people living nearby and along the riverbank,  traditional populations, who only get checked up on their health every couple of months when the Primary Health Care Team approaches them to assist these populations in very specific demands and check their vital signs, sometimes making changes in medications, <del>[</del>based on a static view captured at that moment,<del>]</del> that cannot be tracked to see if they worked due to the fact that by the time another health team reaches them it will be months or years later.</p>
<p>The Life Sign project will impact their lives by filling the existing gap between these populations and the health care team. It also allows them to be able to check their glucose and blood pressure in an easy way through the kits distributed, and the information of those signs shared automatically with our app will be accessible to the health care team that already assists them, so any sort of concerning change in these signs will be assessed by the team so that necessary changes in medication or instructions to look for a healthcare facility will be transmitted to the patient via app.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our app will also contain educational videos about lifestyle habits to improve control of the disease and overall wellbeing that can be watched by the whole family. Our app will be intuitive and easy to use due to the lower level of education of most of these people. We will also partner with indigenous people who also speak Portuguese to offer our educational videos in the local indigenous languages, to increase accessibility.
</p>
<p> The healthcare team will be able to track any concerning signs and make the right changes in medication without having to wait many months before seeing the patient again, as well as tightening the contact between the health<del> </del>care team and patient, it will also serve as an educational platform that will actively aim to improve the control of the disease of those in the family with <del> </del>existing conditions as well as improve the quality of life of those people. </p>
<p> Thus, it will serve as not only primary but also secondary prevention of health, which will be more cost effective for the Health System, saving thousands of dollars each year. When the system is in fully functional, the price that would fund one transportation in an emergency context ($30.000) will be able to track vital sings of 25.000 families per month. </p>
<p>By having this robust approach, we will create a positive impact on these health professionals by optimizing their work for high-complexity tasks that are nowadays only done physically. It will also enable them to serve more areas at a timeand focus their attention to those who really need it, creating strategies specifically for them based on the collected information. In the end, superior health assistance will be provided to everyone at a lower cost, because of the focus on the prevention rather than on high-complexity emergence management in remote area. 
</p>","<p>Our team is composed of people who live in the Amazon and are aware of the real conditions and complexities of this region, especially when it comes to health in fragile contexts.

<p> The proximity of medical students from the Federal University of Amazonas with the reality of these isolated areas and services, such as the Telemedicine Center provided by the university hospital, is helping us integrate the proposed solution with the existing health infrastructure that is underutilized to make a greater impact with our project.</p>
<p>In favor of building the application interface, keeping in mind that it must be easy to use and intuitive, we have a computer engineer that already has vast experience developing apps and creating well thought product design. We are also working on a voice accessibility function so that illiterate people will be able to use it as well, not only in Portuguese but also in their native languages.</p>
<p>To make the educational videos for the platform, our team is charged with the most recent evidence about cardiovascular diseases to showcase the best ways to control existing diseases, as well as to have a healthy lifestyle. Our team has a large experience working with volunteer programs that have close contact with less affortunate populations, so we can create content that’s easy to understand while also sharing important information to this population. </p>
<p>We have the main telehealth service in the region linked to our university and we are currently sharing experiences. The main developers of a big program that supports pregnant women in remote areas, an obstetrician, and a surgeon shared technical challenges, implementation process difficulties, and ways they communicate with authorities in these areas. Their know-how in this field is valuable to take into account so that our solution is well thought out and we face less difficulties in the implementation process by already foreseeing challenges and also planning the best way to get in touch with the authorities and population.    </p>
<p>To assess the dynamics of the local naval hub and the difficulties of inland navigation and peculiarities of waterway transport in the Amazon region, we have a marine engineer. Through the application of technical concepts and the norms of the maritime authority, the Brazilian Navy, the study has technical and normative support to be developed. Moreover, the engineer inserted in the local shipping market knows the peculiarities of intercity navigation, increasing the reliability of the study in relation to the dynamics of local navigation. In short, the presence of a naval engineer is essential to ensuring logistical feasibility and successful implementation in the region.</p>
<p>Our team still requires more people with experience in networks and technology of information, as well as business. We intend to find these people after funding. 
</p>","Enable continuity of care, particularly around primary health, complex or chronic diseases, and mental health and well-being.",Manaus,Brazil,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone","<p>Our solution consists of multiple steps to enhance the reachability and efficiency of healthcare by reducing the gap between patients and the healthcare system. Currently, these multiple steps have passed the stage of concept and are being tested, in different stages of maturity, in simulated and real-world conditions.</p>
<p>We understand that our approach is very audacious, and other attempts have failed in the past. Therefore, we decided to start with the hardest part and main barrier, which is the network infrastructure and hardware needed to surpass the physical distance and isolation inherent to our problem.</p>
<p>Presently, we already have a functioning network in Amazonas State that is independent of internet connections and the power grid. We achieve it by using a decentralized infrastructure in which every device (a radio with a LoRa protocol connection) is a hub to connect the others, creating a robust mesh connection. We also had extreme conditions in mind when we developed this system, which is entirely solar-powered and portable, in a region that changes seasonally and has one of the greatest solar irradiation indexes in the world. This allows for immediate use since it is preset to connect automatically to our network.</p>
<p>In order to simulate the environment of boats traveling by the river, we used our drones equipped with one of these small devices that transmit long-range signals that connect to multiple autonomous antennas (which are based on LoRa protocol and have Bluetooth to connect to the cellphone, like a WI-FI router, but instead of the internet, it connects to our long-range network) arranged in different locations in the city and outside it.</p>
<p>Our platform is also being developed as a prototype, with some basic functions already operating. It is being constantly modified to improve the user experience, reliability, and features. When it comes to the data migration from the sensors (glucometer, sphygmomanometer, and oximeter), we are currently working on ways to optimize this synchronization with our platform efficiently after being read by these instruments. Some manufacturers create barriers that make this migration difficult and demand some extra steps. So we are putting extra effort into this.</p>
<p>Working closely with the experts from the Federal University of Amazonas Telemedicine Center also facilitates our communication with different cities in our state to implement new features based on specific demands, such as using native language voice in our app to better interact with the indigenous population, which represents a significant percentage of the total in some cities. It is also creating a well-suited prototype that can be used more widely when we start our tests with a small number of patients with the help of the Telehealth Center.</p><p><br /></p><figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/61269_PHOTO-2023-05-09-03-14-43_1440x810.jpg"" alt=""61269_PHOTO-2023-05-09-03-14-43_1440x810.jpg"" /></figure><figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/61271_PHOTO-2023-05-09-03-14-44_1440x810.jpg"" alt=""61271_PHOTO-2023-05-09-03-14-44_1440x810.jpg"" /></figure><figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/61272_PHOTO-2023-05-09-03-14-45_1440x810.jpg"" alt=""61272_PHOTO-2023-05-09-03-14-45_1440x810.jpg"" /></figure><figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/61276_PHOTO-2023-05-09-03-14-45%202_1440x810.jpg"" alt=""61276_PHOTO-2023-05-09-03-14-45%202_1440x810.jpg"" /></figure><figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/61282_PHOTO-2023-05-11-11-02-12_1440x810.jpg"" alt=""61282_PHOTO-2023-05-11-11-02-12_1440x810.jpg"" /></figure><figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/61283_PHOTO-2023-05-11-11-02-12%202_1440x810.jpg"" alt=""61283_PHOTO-2023-05-11-11-02-12%202_1440x810.jpg"" /></figure><p><br /></p>","<p>Currently, we are in the prototype phase and have not reached the public yet. However, we are preparing for our pilot study, which will serve 75 families and expand to 150 in each of the 10 zones after the second year (reaching approximately 9000 people).</p>","<p>Historically, MIT Solve has given people real opportunities to innovate and create a better future in their context and globally.</p>
<p> Being residents of one of the poorest regions in a developing country, such as Brazil, has always limited our attempts to create solutions to our real-life problems due to restrictions ranging from geographic isolation to economic limitations. Our team is composed mostly of experts with experience in our healthcare context who also appreciate technology and understand that its place in a digital world (especially with the fourth industrial revolution) can be the biggest instrument for equalizing health access in centuries.</p>
<p>By working in our hospitals, we can see how inequitable this health access can be. We can also feel the bad experiences and pain this population suffers during their journey searching for care. This difficulty is not limited to patients but also to the healthcare team, and a lot of these problems could be solved if we utilized technologies in better and more efficient ways, especially in healthcare. Sometimes spending 14 days of ship travel for an appointment that lasts 15 minutes and could be done remotely is a burden on the health system and also on patients time and quality of life.</p>
<p>Being nonconformist with the present arrangement and dynamics in health access and how they drive unequal and poor assistance, as in other areas, is a powerful tool that induces innovation and different ways of thinking in order to solve historical problems.</p>
<p>There is no better institution in the world that aggregates knowledge, principles, and a strong connection between the biggest centers of technology development. So, this is the reason why our team is trying to reach this network to help with our project implementation and consequently improve the lives of those who are invisible to most of the world.</p>
<p>We are sure that this arrangement of already existing technologies applied to solve this specific problem is a great approach that could also be modified to work in different environments that, for some reasons, have isolation, poverty, and difficult access as problems, like some regions in Latin America, the Middle East, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia. So, it is important to have the best directions, such as those provided by MIT’s experts and its network.
</p>","Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Legal or Regulatory Matters, Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)","No, Solve is the first network joined",,Instagram,,"<p>Our solution uses some existing technologies in an innovative manner with a novel arrangement. When we were developing the solution, we knew it had to be something low-cost and easy to use, especially in our context, where a significant number of our users are illiterate or indigenous.</p>
<p>As said before, our target problem is multifactorial and must be solved as such. By creating the possibility for these patients to analyze their basic life signs, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and blood oxygenation (which is done extensively worldwide), we only overcome part of the problem. The connection and isolation problems are the real challenges to resolve. This is why our solution also contemplates this part of the bigger issue.</p>
<p>When it comes to connection in remote areas, the easiest way is to utilize a satellite connection. However, when the cost is taken into consideration, it is unpractical to utilize one antenna plus service fees per user or per group of users. Having this in mind, we analyzed the dynamic of this region (from social to economic and physical) and thought about what the main common point was between all these families.</p>
<p>So, we concluded that a river-based transportation system was the answer. The ships passing daily in front of these families could be used as a common point of reference. These ships could be equipped with a direct link to a satellite, and, when equipped with a robust set of antennas, they could create a radius of signal that would allow each point in its course to be connected for some minutes (9 minutes to be precise) each time the ship passes through it.</p>
<p>However, this connection alone can be narrow, especially for medical purposes. To solve this issue, we developed the second part of our connection approach. Using long-range (LoRa) devices that connect as nodes in a mesh network, also connecting to patients’ phones, we offer a robust secondary network that is slow and has limited bandwidth but, on the other hand, is very stable and can connect patients for hundreds of kilometers.</p>
<p>This hybrid model is ideal in this context. When combined with a platform that collects vital signs from these patients in a very intuitive and easy way (due to its automatic synchronization), it can offer a very useful tool for a multidisciplinary team's prospective follow-up.</p>
<p>This arrangement of already existing technologies, never combined at such a level for medical purposes in a very needy region, is original and novel, particularly when the costs are covered (by far) by the amount of money the public health system will save.
</p>","<p>Our impact in the short term—such as in the next year—will be initial but remarkable. We have plans to start testing our system—which is in the final phase of internal tests with our hardware prototypes currently being tested for work in extreme conditions only using solar power—in the next few months with real families in partnership with some local health administrators in a defined area in the extreme interior of Amazonas State in Brazil.</p>
<p>During the first year, we hope to start seeing the situation of these families improve. This is our main goal. Another goal is improving our system with increments on our team, which today is very dedicated but, for obvious reasons, doesn’t have the total experience needed for the future phases of our expansions. The incorporation of new members with specific skills will put our project on another level when it comes to delivering the best product possible to our patients, healthcare providers, and the public system.
</p>
<p> We also hope to create not just a better team in terms of hard skills but also when it comes to fraternity, humanity, and a sense of family—where everyone feels comfortable acting, innovating, and disagreeing constructively—in our project.</p>
<p> To achieve these goals, we are trying to connect ourselves with experts and have the appropriate guidance and cooperation. Participating in MIT Solve is one of these attempts.</p>
<p> For the middle term (the next five years), our goal is to successfully overcome the most difficult part, which is the initial implementation (phase 1), and start expanding our solution for several regions (phase 2), with thousands of people being helped and having their lives improved by our product. Phase 2 starts after the first year and ends two years later.</p>
<p>Due to the natural maturation process, in phase 3, our most sophisticated prototypes of unmanned ships should be working in the next few years. Our financial sustainability is reached in this phase, after the third year after implementation. We are focusing on these long-term developments now because we know that even with a great and robust idea, there is room for improvement, and using these technologies, we will be able to create a much more reliable and robust network. In order to achieve this, studies are being done, and we are working on the construction of our first drone equipped with a satellite antenna with a cheaper technology than Starlink for low-data connections.
</p>
<p> During the second year (phase 2), our costs will be $3,72 per family per month, and after the third year, a decrease of more than half of the price occurs, so it will be $2.00 per family per month. All costs were calculated counting StarLink antennas; with our progress toward a satellite antenna with cheaper technology, this cost will decrease even further. Therefore, during years four and five (phase 3), we intend to implement our solution for a maximum of $1.20 per family per month, but there's room for reductions.</p>","3. Good Health and Well-being, 10. Reduced Inequalities","<p>Our plan of implementation, which starts before the prototyping phase, is well defined and establishes some important marks, not just focused on economic growth but also on consolidation of our technology, increments in our team, and the development of new paths (such as those mentioned before) to ensure the best utilization of resources and better service for everyone utilizing our system.</p>
<p>So, by comparing our current marks with our original plan, we can interpret if something is going slower than expected or faster than we anticipated. We did not start testing out the product with patients due to some ethical and legal approvals. We also want to ensure our platform is as stable as it can be when reaching patients, particularly those who live in remote areas and may need our solution in life-threatening situations.</p>
<p>Another thermometer used to identify if our operations are going according to plan is how our current partners, such as prefectures, telemedicine centers, and healthcare teams, interpret and interact with our product or prototype.
</p>
<p> As a project with no funders yet, we are currently using our own capital to develop these technologies and maintain the course. So, we understand that sometimes it will be a factor that implies delays (which have not happened so far but are a possibility).</p>","<p>Our solution, as said before, is focused on primary and secondary prevention. It is well known in the academic field—especially in healthcare—how positive and truly resolute it is to invest in prevention instead of trying to solve problems in their late stages of development (usually with proportions much bigger).</p>
<p>The backbone of our strategy is offering healthcare for people historically disconnected from the system, but the main objective of doing this is to reduce the evolution of the problem (cardiovascular diseases, in this case). Support for emergencies is an additional feature that improves the chain of support. However, the biggest results over time will come with the prospective follow-up. </p>
<p>By implementing a system such as this, it is possible to improve the health and, consequently, the quality of life of these populations. This personal value, which can be very subjective, has the power to modify an entire life with a small initial change (not just for the patient but for healthcare teams and the functioning of our health system).
</p>
<p> Patients, with better health assistance, can experience a physical health improvement and a sense of being important and someone who deserves attention. It can create a positive impact that is transmitted from that moment into the future. When this logic is applied in a familiar context, the potential is even bigger. Physical improvement is responsible for another kind of transformation in cardiovascular diseases: proportionately, patients execute activities they stop doing due to their disease and its metabolic implications; moreover, they live longer.</p>
<p> With better control of their diseases and constant assistance, fewer people will develop aggravating outcomes, such as acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, our solution, which at first seems solely focused on controlling the disease, will also impact the outcomes of patients and reduce mortality since most patients in interior regions in an urgency context don't make it until they get to bigger cities in which health care is equipped to tackle more serious situations.</p>
<p> The healthcare team will suffer less from extenuating periods of adverse field work and, consequently, be able to deliver better assistance when needed due to conditions that propitiate this improved performance.</p>
<p> These factors, together, impact the entire community, creating a better environment. This is how evolution is done and how small steps can, in the end, create an enormous transformation in society.</p>","<p>Our technology, as mentioned before, can be divided into two main parts. The hardware part involves the sensors, the antennas installed on the ship, and the devices that allow communication between multiple users over long distances. The second part is the software, which evolves our application on the user’s cellphone, our platform accessed by the health team, and the software on the long-range devices.</p>
<p>The antennas installed on top of ships are composed of a starlink antenna, which creates a link with low-orbit satellites, and some wireless amplification routers (which extend the range of this internet signal). It is important to keep in mind that these electromagnetic waves emitted by the repeater can reflect on the water surface, extending even more the original range of this wireless repeater. This set of antennas is connected to the electrical supply in the ship but also has a pack of 18650 lithium-ion batteries, providing 6 hours of working after being disconnected from the power supply. This disconnection, as well as any other interference in normal functioning, is reported to our main platform with location and other telemetry data from the antenna. Authorities can eventually be informed.</p>
<p>The second part consists of LoRa devices, which are currently working in our prototype network created in a city. Currently, we use portable LILYGO TTGO ESP 32 devices with the software Meshtastic (an open-source software that allows a mesh arrangement between these devices) with some modifications that allow data sharing with specific integration of our LORAWAN Gateway for integration of this data created and flowing by the LoRa network. When the user’s phone has access to the internet, the device is not needed, and the data flows to the database via the internet.</p>
<p>These devices connect via Bluetooth with the user’s phone, synchronize the data from the application, and send it to the main network using the LoRa network. The data navigates this network until it reaches a gateway and migrates via the internet to our platform. We have on our implementation plan a migration for proprietary software on these devices to ensure stability and data protection after the migration to the second phase of our implementation.</p>
<p>The application on the patient’s phone consists of a receiver for the data from the sensors, which connect to the cellphone via Bluetooth (glucometer, blood pressure monitor, and an oximeter). In addition to that, the application allows patients to analyze their data if required. Other sections of the application offer direct communication with the healthcare team and another section where they can find informative content shared by their health provider specifically for their condition, such as recipes, workout tips, medication instructions, and information about the disease and the importance of correct treatment adhesion.
</p>
<p> The healthcare team’s platform, which works on desktops and can be accessed by the browser of mobile devices, works as a database with different types of data categorization beyond patient information, vital signs, and a communication channel (voice, messages, and video, when the internet link allows).</p>",A new application of an existing technology,,"Internet of Things, Robotics and Drones, Software and Mobile Applications",Brazil,Brazil,Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit,,"Currently, our organization has nine volunteers in total from different backgrounds, mostly in health.  We have two part-time staff members (José Trajano and Janana Castro). The seven others are volunteers and work on specific demands. Four medical students, who are interested in innovation and technology. Two obstetricians. One cardiologist—who is the compass of our project since our focus is cardiovascular diseases. One surgeon. One computer engineer. One marine engineer.","Our team has officially been working on this project for 6 months, with the most advances coming in the last three months after we enhanced our team with more engineers as volunteers. The initial phase occurs after the students spend weeks working in these isolated and fragile areas.","<p>Having a multicultural and diverse team is one of the best ways to think about and develop a better future with different perspectives and with everyone in mind. This creates fair progress that includes not just common sense but also those who are different, minorities, and do not share the same principles as us.</p>
<p> Having this in mind, I always try to listen to every single opinion, which has been shown to be the best way to build a strong idea and concept. Having this as one of our base foundations changed our workflow to a much better one. Having different backgrounds composing our team, as well as different ages, religions, colors of the skin, and sexual orientations, makes us a very diverse team already. However, there is always room for new ideas and new thinking.</p>
<p> We are open to engagement for anyone who wants to become part of our team. Currently, we cannot offer payment due to our initial stage, but having an equal and fair system of salary and retribution is one of our main goals. It would be illogical if we, in a project that fights for better equity, had an unfair and excluding internal organization.</p>","<p>The Life Sign Project is a business-to-government model that focuses on offering a connection between patients and the already designated healthcare teams covering isolated areas in developing countries, such as Brazil. Our markets are municipalities due to the organization of the Brazilian health system, which designates the control of low-complexity healthcare to the city administration. This structure of organization is also found in other Latin American countries.</p>
<p>By focusing on the government, we will provide a service that fits into the health infrastructure. It is important to keep in mind that this infrastructure already exists and will achieve a higher level of capillarity with minimal costs and changes if a solution such as ours facilitates the last-mile connection. Therefore, the demand for such a product would be very high.</p>
<p>When the costs of a single emergency transportation of a patient with an easily preventable condition are compared with the cost per user of our solution, the difference is enormous—enough to pay for one year of follow-up for 600 families in the region. There is a clear advantage to focusing on prevention here.
</p>
<p> To do so, we have reached out to some municipalities and telehealth centers to design a product that fits into their workflow. They are giving us great feedback and showing big interest in what we are developing so far, offering their locations and infrastructure at no cost to host our future pilot study.</p>
<p> After studying how we will charge for our service, we concluded that the best way is to use the number of patients using our system. It starts with a base price for a minimal number of users for a viable operation, calculated based on specific factors like geography, the number of devices, and the number of sensors in the kit. This will be agreed upon in a contract for two years for each area covering these users.</p>
<p> This cost can be reduced with more patients incorporated into our network, which is good for the municipalities and creates a stronger network for our system. The cost per family drastically reduces after the first year (which is our pilot), reaching a value of U$ 1.20 per family per month after the third year (it started at U$ 3.72 on the pilot).</p>
<p> Having our initial field in the Amazon allows us to create a very strong and resilient business model due to the difficulties present in this region with its fragile healthcare system. It allows a posterior expansion in an easier way than what would occur if we tried the opposite (in a context that does not match our target population and market).</p>
<p>There are some companies offering internet (via satellite or radio) in the Amazon currently. However, the price is very high, the service is unreliable, and it requires a complex installation with their own personnel. These factors make it impracticable for most of the low-income population in this area, for any telehealth company, and for the government to pay for telehealth services with great capillarity.
</p>",Government (B2G),"<p>The Life Sign Project has an implementation plan composed of three phases. The first phase consists of our pilot, when we will start operations with twenty families. The second phase is our expansion (during the second and third years), when we will establish our product with changes from phase 1 (pilot), focusing on enhancing our penetration into new areas. The last one consists of several cities being reached and novel technologies being implemented.</p>
<p>During conversations with local telehealth specialists and teams from these areas, we defined one to host our pilot that shares the same difficulties found in other isolated regions in the Amazon. We will join the healthcare team during routine visits to the region to provide our bundle (devices and sensors) and give instructions on how to utilize the user platform for 75 families (25 in the villages and 50 in remote areas).</p>
<p>After that, we will follow them remotely with their health team for nine months and collect feedback (from both sides) on how our product is working and how it could be optimized. This information will help us make some adjustments for the next phase.</p>
<p>The cost of this entire first year of operations will be around $15,000, including the initial implementation costs, the hardware needed, and the software refinement, which represents most of this cost ($9,000). This refinement will complement our system with features reviewed by professionals to ensure cybersecurity and data privacy compliance before it reaches the public. This hardware and software infrastructure will serve us during all our future operations, making the cost significantly lower with more users. The implementation costs make the first year in each zone the most expensive.
</p>
<p> After that, with a working system, nine other zones with an increment in the number of families (150 each) and the same characteristics as the first one will host our expansion (some of them already defined). In this phase, we will start charging the municipalities for the service. As said before, the cost will decrease as the phase progresses, going from $3,72 to $2,00 per family per month at the end.</p>
<p> In the last phase, when economic sustainability is reached, we will have the lowest price and the best performance yet due to increments in our network and dilution of the costs (around $1,20 per family per month). The cost of operations will also be reduced by the implementation of better tools developed during Phase 2 and the cheapening of components. So, the costs per user can be lower.</p>
<p>In this phase, new approaches will be used to create a truly robust and versatile network with extended capabilities that responds to specific demands in real time, such as dedicating a high level of health assistance through hours of high-speed connection to a specific area. It will be possible by using a system that consists of solar-powered drones with several hours of autonomy working as a platform for our high-speed link. Our team is currently building the first prototype.
</p>","<p>When we start thinking about how to create a solution to the gap between patients and the health system, we consider several solutions, and initially, only the satellite link installed on ships passing through this region was our plan. It is, by itself, a great solution for this problem. However, during the research phase, we found other peripheral solutions that consolidated our approach and reduced costs. The decentralized network is one of these solutions.</p>
<p>With these improvements, we are optimizing our product to the point that its cost for an entire village is several hundred times less than what our market spends on only one patient being transported to a big city by plane and hospitalized (costing around $10.000 and $30.000) due to an avoidable disease with a simple prevention such as a hypertensive emergency or organ failure due to chronic hypertension.
</p>
<p> Currently, we are not operating commercially, but we invested some money from the team members to create our prototypes to allow us to start testing our technology, which happened at a lower cost than expected. With funding, our team will be improved by adding new members with specific skills that we currently do not have, such as network-specialized IT professionals and a lawyer for legal counseling.</p>
<p> Nonetheless, during some talks with municipalities and health authorities, interest was shown in financing our project to be incorporated in that specific city. We do not accept these offers because it would limit our operations to only one city and we would be incorporated into their administration. For now, we want to be able to operate freely from the bonds of a local institution, whether it's public or private, so that we can innovate by seeing our local reality through our own innovative perspective and be able to think of possibilities and solutions without the bias of past projects and decisions.</p>",True,Pass,,Pass,,,,"{""criteria_1"": {""result"": ""pass"", ""reason"": ""The proposal is complete, intelligible, and appropriate.

This region faces unique issues due to its geography, socioeconomic factors, and reliance on a river-based transportation system which complicates timely access to healthcare services. The proposal seeks to bridge the gap between patients and health systems by leveraging low-cost, existing technologies, including a kit comprised of a glucometer, sphygmomanometer, and oximeter, alongside a mobile application designed for ease of use by illiterate users and educational content tailored to local cultural practices.

This solution is at the prototype stage of development, with a decentralized network infrastructure already functional in the Amazonas State, independent of the internet and power grid. This network functions through a mesh of LoRa devices, enabling long-distance, low-bandwidth communication integral for synchronizing health data from remote patients to healthcare teams. In addition, the initiative plans to incorporate satellite connectivity through Starlink antennas installed on boats, exploiting the daily traffic along rivers for data transfer, with the aim of improving healthcare delivery while reducing costs and optimizing existing telemedicine infrastructures.

The target beneficiaries are the remote populations living near the Amazon River, who currently receive infrequent health checks due to the logistical challenges of the region. The proposal aims to provide these families with the means to monitor vital health parameters and communicate with healthcare providers, thereby facilitating continuous care and potentially reducing preventable health emergencies that result in costly and life-threatening delays in care.

Financial sustainability is envisioned through a business-to-government model, focusing on integrating this solution within existing healthcare infrastructures managed by municipalities, emphasizing a phased deployment starting with a pilot to serve initial families, expanding over time based on lessons learned and systemic improvements. Notably, the team behind this solution is composed of individuals with direct experience and expertise relevant to the challenge, including medical students, healthcare professionals, and engineers all based in the region, ensuring an informed and contextual approach to solution development and implementation.

75473,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,The solution for accessible and efficient healthcare in vulnerable communities,"<p>SOIK's SPAQ solution aims to address the specific problem of poor health service levels in fragile contexts, particularly the high maternal mortality rate in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where pregnant women are a hundred times more likely to die than in developed countries due to weak health systems. The major contributing factors to this problem are three missing integrations: new digital solutions are not integrated into routine processes of examination, data collectors are not integrated into the user group of collected data, and customer success is not integrated into key project objectives.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, SPAQ provides an integrated digital package of different devices, software, and consumables for daily use by small African health centers, with a smartphone app as the platform. SPAQ enables the digitalization of antenatal consultations (ANCs) to facilitate data collection, benefit the data collectors, and increase the quality of service. The solution is also designed to create both clinical and financial impacts, with a focus on improving patients' satisfaction by understanding their needs, increasing the number of customers, and generating income for the health centers.</p>
<p>The scale of the problem is significant, not just in the DRC but also in other fragile contexts around the world where health systems are weak or disrupted by conflicts, displacement, natural disasters, and pandemics. According to the World Health Organization, about 830 women die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related complications every day, with the vast majority (99%) of maternal deaths occurring in developing countries. In the DRC, the maternal mortality rate is 493, and many pregnant women do not have access to basic health services, including antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care.</p>
<p>SPAQ's innovative solution addresses these challenges by integrating digital health technologies and business model innovations to improve resilience in health systems and ensure access to quality health services for underserved communities, including pregnant women, refugees, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and older adults. By providing an all-in-one digital package of devices and software, integrating data collectors into the user group of collected data, and creating both clinical and financial impacts, SPAQ has the potential to make a significant positive impact on maternal and child health outcomes in fragile contexts.</p>","<p>Our solution is called SPAQ, an integrated digital obstetrics healthcare service designed for small health centers in fragile contexts. SPAQ is an all-in-one package that includes a smartphone, software, medical devices, solar batteries, identification cards, and other consumables. The solution works by providing a smartphone app that guides health workers through the standard antenatal consultation (ANC) process, with innovative devices such as portable ultrasound and fetal monitors linked to the platform. This integration allows for comprehensive and accurate examinations without any omissions, with abnormality alerts and automatic displays to avoid missing signs of high-risk pregnancies.</p>
<p>SPAQ also enables the operator of data collection to benefit from the data. The health workers input the results of the examinations into the SPAQ app, with some indicators such as blood pressures automatically displayed with alerts to avoid missing signs of high-risk pregnancies. The data is registered in a cloud server and can be shared with experts in urban areas to help local health workers remotely.</p>
<p>Moreover, SPAQ is designed to create both clinical and financial impacts, assuring financial sustainability. The solution includes a function for pregnant women to answer questionnaires, which helps health centers to understand what patients want and increase the number of customers. By continuously collecting data on patient satisfaction, SPAQ and health centers can improve the quality of service focusing on patients' needs, which are sometimes different from clinical quality. During a 4-month trial in 7 health centers in Kenge, DRC, the centers saw 74% increases in ANCs and 42% in income, which can cover our subscription fees as well as creating clinical impacts such as 28 lives saved.</p>
<p>SPAQ also collaborates with community volunteers who are given smartphones with the app installed to go around the villages and conduct interviews with pregnant women. By doing so, even pregnant women living in remote areas with limited access to medical facilities can have their basic medical information incorporated into the system. Abnormal alerts notify the appropriate medical authorities via SMS, providing them with information about high-risk pregnancies and enabling them to take prompt action.</p>
<p>Overall, SPAQ's integrated digital healthcare service aims to improve the quality and accessibility of obstetric healthcare in fragile contexts, providing a comprehensive and sustainable solution for small health centers.</p>","<p>SPAQ targets small health centers in fragile contexts, specifically in underserved communities where pregnant women are at high risk due to poor quality of health services. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), for example, the maternal mortality rate is 493 per 100,000 live births, which is a hundred times higher than in developed countries like Japan. These women and their unborn children are often left without access to quality healthcare, as many small health centers lack the infrastructure, equipment, and trained staff to provide adequate antenatal care.</p>
<p>SPAQ is designed to directly and meaningfully improve the lives of pregnant women and health workers in these underserved communities. By providing an all-in-one package of digital obstetrics healthcare services, including a smartphone app, medical devices, and consumables, SPAQ aims to facilitate daily use and improve the quality of care. The app guides health workers through a comprehensive antenatal care process, which includes the use of innovative devices such as portable ultrasound and fetal monitors that are linked with the smartphone app platform. As a result, health workers can cover all standard indicators without any omissions and provide pregnant women with comprehensive care.</p>
<p>SPAQ also addresses the issue of data collection and use in underserved communities. The app integrates the process of digitalized antenatal care, enabling data collectors to benefit from the data collected. Health workers can input examination results into the app, and the app can automatically display alerts for abnormal indicators such as high blood pressure. All data is registered in a cloud server to be shared with experts in urban areas, who can provide remote assistance to local health workers. This allows for a more informed decision-making process and enables health workers to better identify high-risk pregnancies and provide appropriate care.</p>
<p>Finally, SPAQ addresses the financial sustainability of small health centers. By incorporating patient satisfaction questionnaires into the app, SPAQ enables health centers to understand patients’ needs and improve the quality of service. This has resulted in an increase in patient visits and income for health centers. As a result, health workers can receive better compensation and have a more stable work environment, which in turn can improve their motivation and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>In summary, SPAQ targets pregnant women and health workers in underserved communities in fragile contexts. By providing an integrated digital healthcare platform, SPAQ aims to improve the quality of care and access to care, enable informed decision-making, and address the financial sustainability of small health centers. Through these efforts, SPAQ can directly and meaningfully improve the lives of pregnant women and health workers in these communities.</p>","<p>Our team is well-positioned to deliver this solution as we have a deep understanding of the local communities and their needs.

SPAQ is an all-in-one integrated digital package designed for use in small health centers within vulnerable communities. This package consists of a smartphone app, software, medical devices, solar batteries, identification cards, and consumables. These components work together to digitalize antenatal consultations (ANCs), facilitating data collection, enhancing data usability for health workers, and improving service quality. The solution has been developed to address the lack of integration between new digital solutions and routine health processes, data collectors and users, and customer success in project objectives.

SPAQ's impact has been tested in a growth stage, indicated by its deployment in one or more communities with observable results. Evidence of this stage includes a 4-month trial in 7 health centers in Kenge, DRC, which reported a 74% increase in ANCs and a 42% increase in income for the health centers. Additionally, the service is already serving 3,500 people and has secured significant funding and commitment from the DRC Ministry of Health for further deployment.

The solution aims to serve small health centers in fragile contexts, specifically targeting pregnant women and health workers in underserved communities. By leveraging digital technologies, SPAQ seeks to make healthcare more accessible and efficient for at-risk populations, including pregnant women, refugees, ethnic minorities, disabled individuals, and the elderly.

The team behind SPAQ is positioned as well-versed in the local context, with the leader having over five years of experience living and working in the DRC alongside local staff familiar with the healthcare sector. This background, combined with extensive field research and community engagement, supports the team's capacity to deliver this solution effectively.

SPAQ addresses the challenge of increasing local capacity and resilience in health systems. It operates in several African countries and plans to expand into Malawi within the next year. The business model relies on direct sales and subscription services provided to health centers and partnerships with governments and aid agencies for scalability and financial sustainability.

The solution incorporates innovative digital technologies such as portable medical devices that seamlessly integrate with a smartphone app. This integration enables comprehensive monitoring and data collection, enhancing the decision-making process for healthcare providers. 

To measure progress towards impact goals, the team uses several key indicators, including the number of health facilities where SPAQ is installed, healthcare workers trained, digital consultations performed, and reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality rates. These metrics align with the organization's theory of change, focusing on improving access to quality healthcare through digital innovations to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality rates.

By focusing on a scalable and sustainable approach, supported by evidence from its trial in the DRC, SPAQ targets significant improvements in maternal and child health outcomes in fragile contexts over the next five years."
75478,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,"A people-powered, technology-enabled Emergency Surgery Fund for life-saving healthcare","<p>Every year, 17 million lives are lost to surgically treatable conditions—5x greater than malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS combined. High-quality surgeries cost, on average, 5x higher than a person’s monthly salary in Kenya, 6x higher in Cambodia, 9x higher in Haiti, and 13x higher in Uganda. Despite the alarming need for this life-saving care, safe surgery remains vastly underfunded, and the reality has only worsened for marginalized communities and the world’s most vulnerable due to the COVID pandemic. </p>
<p>At Watsi, we’re bringing people together around the world to change this, using technology to connect everyday people with individuals who do not have access to this critical care. We know that every patient we reach together unlocks a lifetime of potential, enabling patients and their families to have a higher quality of life and be more active members of their communities. Experts estimate that failing to invest in surgical care could cost Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) as much as $12.3 trillion in lost GDP by 2030. We also know that high-performing surgical programs help create stronger, more sustainable, and resilient hospitals and health systems - with positive impacts that will even protect communities in the face of future pandemics. In short, Watsi is moving us closer to a world with health for all.</p>
<p>In working to build a future where people everywhere have access to safe, dignified, and high-quality healthcare, we have seen firsthand how for many around the world, attaining good health is a complicated undertaking that depends on much more than just their ability to get to a good doctor when they are sick. At the core of health disparities across the globe is a phenomenon called the health-poverty cycle: income inequality, often perpetuated and exacerbated by historical oppression, leads to social and built environments that foster poorer health and lower educational attainment. This, in turn, puts communities we are trying to reach at higher risk of disease and early death - and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>If, for example, a baby is born and grows up in an area where there is poor air and water quality, limited access to fresh foods, high rates of violence, or insufficient access to essential healthcare services, they are at a higher risk of having or developing conditions such as mobility-impacting genu varum (bowleggedness), neural tube defects, or cardiac abnormalities, all of which need surgical intervention. In fact, these birth conditions along with limb conditions and hydrocephalus accounted for more than one out of every five Watsi patients in 2022.</p>
<p>Individuals in vulnerable communities, including our patients, are often caught in a negative feedback loop which begins with their social and built environment, the air they breathe, the food they eat, and the stressors they face. We are on a mission to disrupt this feedback loop and build a world where everyone has access to healthcare, and we are using the unstoppable power of technology and human connection to make this possible.</p>","<p>Watsi is building technology to create a world with health for all. Our platform helps the world’s most vulnerable patients access private capital through people-powered philanthropy to fund the life-changing surgery they need.  100% of crowdfunding donations made through our innovative technology platform — the first of its kind in the healthcare space — directly fund surgical care. Since our founding we’ve raised over $16 million for patients, with an average donation of $52. We work entirely with local medical partners to create sustainable, locally-led programs that are meeting urgent healthcare needs of the people in their communities. </p>
<p>While there are countless social, environmental, and economic determinants of health that play a role in the health-poverty cycle, at Watsi, we are focused on the economic piece of the puzzle: removing the financial barrier at the point of care in hopes of shielding people from crushing medical debt, delaying needed healthcare, or not having treatment at all. We leverage our platform to connect donors anywhere in the world with patients spanning 30 countries who are in need of life-saving surgical care but cannot afford it.</p>
<p>Leveraging the best of technology and humanity, on our platform, people can:</p>
<p>1) Meet a patient who needs life-changing healthcare</p>
<p>2) Help directly fund their treatment with a donation of as little as $5</p>
<p>3) Receive an update on their impact after the patient has surgery</p>
<p>At Watsi, we are 100% committed to being radically transparent, impact-focused, and patient-centered.</p>","<p>Watsi funds life-saving surgical care for individuals around the world who do not have access to it. The majority of our medical partnerships are in East Africa, Southeast Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>For Watsi patients, a healthy life is influenced by numerous factors, many largely out of their own control. A patient’s social and built environment, and the resulting educational and economic opportunities or lack thereof, either positions them with a greater chance of enjoying a healthy life or adds to the struggle of staying healthy.</p>
<p>Beth Wangigi, leading our Watsi partnership with African Mission Healthcare in Kenya, shared:</p>
<p>“Those lacking sufficient income channels and savings often end up foregoing treatment due to the cost factor. Poor health forces the patient and their family to choose between seeking treatment and meeting other basic needs. It is not uncommon to find assets being sold to offset medical bills. Where a chronic illness is involved, seeking treatment has led many households into further impoverishment.”</p>
<p>Such is the case with <a href=""https://watsi.org/profile/b994c8365ee3-mary?ref=blog.watsi.org"">Mary</a>, a Watsi patient who runs a small eatery and earns $2/day while her husband tends to their small-scale farm. They own one cow and rely on proceeds from the eatery and from selling milk from their cow to make ends meet. When Mary was diagnosed with breast cancer and her doctors told her she needed an urgent mastectomy to prevent metastasis, she and her husband were faced with the difficult decision of selling their cow in order for Mary to seek medical attention. Even then, they barely had enough to cover the tests and the proposed treatment thereafter. Fortunately, the Watsi community came together to fund Mary’s surgery after her story was shared on our platform.</p>
<p>Mary is one of the countless patients we meet where basic family needs are sacrificed in order to access essential medical care, or vice versa. In fact, <a href=""https://b6cf2cfd-eb09-4859-92a9-a8f002c3bcef.filesusr.com/ugd/346076_713dd3f8bb594739810d84c1928ef61a.pdf?ref=blog.watsi.org"">a groundbreaking study</a> by The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery estimates that 33 million people globally face catastrophic expenditure each year to access surgery, and an additional 48 million people when accounting for costs related to accessing surgical treatment such as food and transportation.</p>
<p>We hope that one day organizations like Watsi will become obsolete and we will have collectively achieved global health equity. Until then, the continued need for Watsi illustrates the broken systems that exist worldwide and how, as a result, patients are left behind. While we work toward long-term solutions that may take decades, Watsi has an immediate, tangible, and life-changing impact on the people we serve.</p>
<p>As Beth further shared:</p>
<p>“Productive partnerships with frontline hospitals and donors like Watsi supporters enable communities in need to access quality health care. Programs like Watsi contribute to restoring the well-being of individuals and their community, and protects them from the health-poverty trap by facilitating access to safe, high-quality, and respectful medical care. The result is a gradual process of breaking barriers to healthcare accessibility which creates a ‘butterfly-effect’ that further shields communities from the health-poverty trap.”</p>","<p>Since our founding in 2012, Watsi has embraced a local and patient-first model. We focus on actively listening to our medical partners and patients, and then we work to get resources to them as directly and efficiently as possible to support the cost of medical treatment. </p>
<p>Every step of the way, we have built a system that rests on a foundation of radical trust and transparency in which we support local hospitals in setting their own priorities on what will have the most impact on patients’ lives. This has led to an open and effective relationship between Watsi and its medical partners in communities around the world. </p>
<p>We also believe in the importance of people-powered philanthropy, which our innovative technology platform is built for, in addressing health inequities. Global health has always been about eliminating health disparities in vulnerable communities. While this is possible through global cooperation, it can only be achieved by making space for local voices and perspectives in both the development and implementation of solutions. How can we ensure that local communities lead the discussions at the table? By calling for the decentralization of both global health and philanthropy with changes such as our innovative funding model, and moving away from traditional bureaucratic, top-down approaches.</p>
<p>How we measure and define our impact is also guided by the communities in which we serve. (More on this can be found in the question, “How are you measuring your progress toward you impact goals?”)</p>
<p>Our organization is led by Mackinnon Engen, who our Co-Founders recruited for a new Executive Director role in late 2019. As a global health and humanitarian professional, her experience has spanned the UN, international and local NGOs, and academic sectors—all with a focus on putting local communities first, deeply listening to their needs, and co-creating meaningful, lasting solutions. Prior to joining Watsi, she helped to oversee international program development for a surgical NGO serving more than 1 million patients around the world through a global network of leading local medical teams. At the UN, she worked to ensure more timely humanitarian assistance reached those most in need as well as helped to coordinate the Secretary-General’s response to the Global Food Crisis. Mackinnon has lived and worked in communities across Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Her research has included topics of organizational leadership and effectiveness, economic impact of health interventions, emergency food security, and humanitarian impact of climate change. She is also the recipient of life-saving surgery herself.</p>

<p>Specifically, becoming a Solver will help us accelerate the creation of an Emergency Surgery Fund program, which will be used to create new pathways to fund critical emergency surgical care. This is a need that has emerged from listening to the local communities we serve, and we are building this new program to help solve for this need. Current barriers to piloting our Emergency Surgery Fund include technical advances needed on our platform (including experimentation with how to integrate emerging AI technology to create efficiencies), deeper exploration to co-create this solution with the communities we serve, and experimentation to create longer-term sustainable health financing mechanisms. </p>
<p>Emergency surgical treatment is the most urgent, and often the most life-saving, of medical care. We aim to adapt the learning we’ve had from building our crowdfunding platform to co-create with our medical partners a new fund that can be leveraged when there is not time, for example, to create an individual patient profile on our platform before beginning to raise funds for the individual needing care. Very often, emergency surgical care is directly linked to maternal/women’s health, particularly emergency C-sections, and also includes emergency surgeries that are due to high-occurring incidents like road traffic accidents, trauma, fractures, and burns. Becoming a Solver will allow us to adapt our technology to pilot this Emergency Surgery Fund, starting with our medical partner in Uganda to enable more safe C-sections, and ultimately expand the number of lives we save every year.</p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)","Yes, this solution is already (or has been in the past) a part of other networks","<p>Y Combinator, Draper Richards Kaplan, Mulago Fellow</p>",Other (please specify),<p>Recommendation from Fast Forward</p>,"<p>We are a health-tech nonprofit powered by an innovative platform that enables anyone to directly fund life-changing surgery for those who otherwise wouldn't have access to this essential care.

<p>At Watsi, we love being nimble and flexible. We are well positioned to continue exploring innovative, tech-focused solutions in our sector - sharing learnings all along the journey with the broader health and nonprofit ecosystem, especially with those who may need to be more conservative with their own tech adoption and investments.</p>
<p>Hear directly what others have said about Watsi:</p>
<p>The New York Times wrote that ""Watsi represents the next generation of charities,” a generation that leverages technology to enable anyone everywhere to create meaningful, lasting impact for those most in need, embraces 100% transparency, and focuses on our shared humanity by helping supporters create a direct connection with the patients they are helping. </p>
<p>Watsi has also been recognized by CNN as one of its top 10 startups to watch and the White House as a ""Champion of Change."" Watsi’s innovative and effective approach drew the early attention of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that provides seed money and mentorship, which selected Watsi as their very first nonprofit.</p>","<p>As an organization with a mission to directly connect people through technology to access life-changing surgery, our impact goals this year are to:</p>

No Poverty, 3. Good Health and Well-being, 4. Quality Education, 5. Gender Equality, 17. Partnerships for the Goals","<p>First and foremost, we measure our impact in lives changed through access to healthcare. For every low-cost, high-impact treatment that we support, this intervention results in additional health, wellbeing, and opportunity for that patient. Even further, the positive benefits often ripple across a whole family and even to a community level, strengthening the health and productivity of the community more broadly.</p>
<p>How we measure and define this impact is also guided by the communities we work with. We begin by listening to the people we serve, understanding their priorities and challenges and working to ensure that we do not add additional burden and administrative paperwork to their already full plates. We learned early on that traditional approaches to impact measurements would likely be onerous for our patients and local medical partners, complicated and inefficient, at times not culturally appropriate, and still may not even provide certainty around our true impact on the real lives of the people we are trying to help. Our values of people over path (putting our patients, health workers, and community partners' needs first), listen &amp; learn (understand problems before prescribing solutions), and move forward (be creative in finding even small ways to keep moving forward, adapting as you try things out) guide how we track and measure impact at Watsi.</p>
<p>On a tactical level, we track surgical outcome data for 100% of Watsi patients, including whether the surgery took place, if the treatment is progressing as planned, if additional treatment is expected to be necessary, if there were complications during or after the procedure, and if we maintained communication with the patient for follow-up. We also receive a post-operative update on all patients that focuses on patient and family-reported outcomes. </p>
<p>Our local medical partners carry out a number of impact-related measurements which vary by community and include: </p>
<ul><li><p>Medical-related follow-up questionnaires and/or visits</p></li><li><p>Qualitative interviews with patient and family member(s) at approximately one month following treatment, including questions such as: </p><ul><li><p>How do you feel now compared to how you felt before the treatment? </p></li><li><p>Are you still experiencing any of the symptoms you had before? </p></li><li><p>Do you have any new symptoms? </p></li><li><p>Are there things you can do now that you could not do before surgery but hoped to?</p></li><li><p>How will the treatment you received help you and your family?</p></li><li><p>How will your life be different after treatment? </p></li><li><p>What are your plans for the future?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Follow-up with random sampling of patients within one year of treatment to check on patient experience and further verify financial need.</p></li></ul><p>We also closely track: </p>
<ul><li><p>Geographical coverage</p></li><li><p>Number and types of treatments that Watsi enables</p></li><li><p>Revenue raised to support medical treatment and sustainability for the organization from recurring donors, corporate partners, and foundations</p></li><li><p>Donor net promoter score (NPS) rating</p></li><li><p>Medical partnership happiness rating</p></li><li><p>Marketing campaign activities and conversion rates</p></li></ul>","<p>Existing Problem: Worldwide, 5 billion people lack access to safe surgical and anesthesia care even though 30% of the total global burden of disease is surgically treatable. In addition, an estimated 33 million people incur catastrophic health expenditures to access surgery each year. Although 17 million lives are lost to surgically treatable conditions every year—5x greater than malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS combined—safe surgery remains vastly underfunded.</p>
<p>Activities: Using an innovative technology platform that directly connects donors around the world with people in need of life-saving care, Watsi funds the cost of surgery for those who need it and supports local medical teams to strengthen the surgical care they provide in their communities. </p>
<p>Outputs: On the patient side, Watsi closely tracks the number of surgeries funded, the number of surgeries performed, the amount of money going towards surgery, and the number of patients operated on (surgical volume). On the medical partner side, Watsi tracks the additional hospital revenue and financial stability created by Watsi’s involvement, the training programs enabled by Watsi’s support, and the level of optimal use of equipment and facilities. </p>
<p>Short-Term Outcomes: Patients are healthier after surgery; there are fewer deaths and fewer individuals living with a treatable disability; catastrophic health expenditures are averted; patients report improvements in quality of life (change in pain, ability to complete day-to-day activities, emotional/mental health, participation in family/community, ability to work or attend school); individuals demonstrate more health-seeking behaviors or greater knowledge of healthcare access in communities served by Watsi’s local medical partners; hospitals and healthcare workers are better able to provide high-quality healthcare in the communities in which Watsi works; Watsi medical partners experience greater financial stability and better health outcomes overall.</p>
<p>Long-Term Outcome: Watsi helps move us toward Universal Health Coverage through investments in innovation, knowledge sharing, and advocacy. Our movement demonstrates for the broader health ecosystem and governments what is possible when financial barriers to life-saving surgical care are removed, ultimately paving the way toward a world where people everywhere can access quality healthcare. This serves as a foundation for full lives, thriving communities, and strengthened health systems - at scale, this is how we build a world with health for all.</p>","<p>Core to Watsi since our founding has been a strong technical foundation and to use technology where it hasn’t traditionally been used to amplify the good that can be created. We’ve built a reliable base of software and in doing so have been careful to build sustainably and minimize the risk of leaving those we are helping in a worse spot. We are known for our web-based interactive platform that easily connects donors with patients in need of life-saving care. We also embrace radical transparency and have built integrations that publish all our financial transactions directly funding healthcare publicly on our website in real-time.</p>
<p>As shared earlier, apart from anchoring our entire model and solution around technology, we have also been one of the first nonprofits to leverage the blockchain and cryptocurrency donations in our work, and we are now exploring how to leverage AI to make Watsi and our medical partners’ time and reporting even more efficient.</p>
<p>Our sustainability strategy and practices for tech implementation are strongly guided by three of our core values:</p>
<p>1. Build to last: We aim to create something that has a positive, lasting impact. We don’t shy away from having hard conversations or making short-term trade-offs if it means our organization, team, and platform will be better positioned to sustain or deepen our impact for the long-term. We also build iteratively so that what we create is usable and impactful all along the journey.</p>
<p>2. Move forward: We are creative about finding ways to move past obstacles. Whether by changing an approach, rethinking a goal, or taking a small action instead of doing nothing, we avoid paralysis and prioritize forward momentum.  This enables us to grow from doing and fail forward, adapting as we learn.</p>
<p>3. People over path: We are unwavering about putting patients, health workers, and community partners first in everything we do, but flexible about the path we take to serve their needs.  We care more about our work making an impact on their lives than we do about the programming languages or strategies we use to make it.</p>",A new application of an existing technology,,"Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, Audiovisual Media, Behavioral Technology, Blockchain, Crowd Sourced Service / Social Networks, Software and Mobile Applications","Bolivia,Cambodia,Colombia,Ethiopia,Haiti,Kenya,Malawi,Philippines,Tanzania,Thailand,Uganda,Myanmar","Bolivia,Cambodia,Colombia,Egypt, Arab Rep.,Ethiopia,Haiti,India,Kenya,Malawi,Philippines,Tanzania,Thailand,Turkiye,Uganda,Myanmar",Nonprofit,,"Given our investments in technology, we are remarkably efficient - leading a lot with a small, mighty team.

Our team members are located across the United States (in the Midwest, South and Northeast) and near New Delhi, India. In addition, 60% of our board members identify as female, including our Board Chair.</p>
<p>We embrace empathy in our work and with each other, and this lends itself to building a culture of belonging, authenticity, and valuing everyone’s unique contributions every day. On our team at Watsi, each person brings their own gifts, and together we make magic out of them. We believe an organization really thrives when all team members feel valued and have ownership and autonomy over their work, even more so at a place like Watsi where you can so clearly and tangibly see your impact in the world. </p>
<p>We publish all our financial transactions directly funding healthcare for people in need publicly on our website in real-time. And, while we are known for our transparency, being tech-forward and women-led, opening up our data, and building (and sometimes failing) in public, what we remain most proud of is being deeply rooted in the needs of our patients and our local medical partners to guide our work every step of the way.</p>
<p>At Watsi, we’ve never shied away from tackling big things or doing things differently, right from the start.</p>","<p>Resources: Our innovative, custom-designed technology platform (watsi.org), brand recognition, and extensive network of donors and volunteers power our work and enable us to directly fund life-saving surgical care for people around the world. </p>
<p>Partners and Key Stakeholders: In order to reach our patients, we partner with leading hospitals and medical teams around the world, with a focus on building long-term partnerships with exceptional local leaders in healthcare who are often overlooked. Our partners are key to our work, and they connect patients in need of support with the Watsi platform.</p>
<p>Value proposition: For our patients, we fund life-saving surgical care that they otherwise would not have access to. For our medical partners, we offer a consistent, reliable revenue stream that enables them to serve more patients, improve their standard of care overall, and leverage additional revenues to grow their operations in service of their communities. For our community of donors, we offer a uniquely joyful, tangible, and impactful way to give back. We have been deeply rooted, since day one, in amplifying the voices of our patients in the most honest and dignified manner, empowering our frontline medical partners and listening to their needs, and sharing—directly and transparently—the impact of each donation with our community. The result: radical change in how healthcare is accessed around the world and in how philanthropy is lived out everyday.</p>
<p>Cost Structure: Our primary cost is direct surgical expenses for patients, which are paid to our local medical partners and hospitals. We take a holistic approach to the cost of care, so this includes medicine, equipment, human resources, as well as other common barriers to care such as transportation or food while at the hospital. Our other expenses include costs related to maintaining our technology platform, onboarding new medical partners and maintaining existing partnerships, our small team, and general operating expenses.</p>
<p>Revenue: Watsi maintains three consistent revenue streams: 1) funds donated through our online crowdfunding platform; 2) unrestricted support from institutional donors/foundations; and 3) partnerships with like-minded corporations who give via a number of mechanisms, including in-kind donations, financial support, employee matching contributions, and volunteer opportunities. Within the broad landscape of global health, our model is uniquely and radically transparent, as 100% of funds donated through our online platform directly fund healthcare. Our partnerships with foundations and corporations (and individual donors who leave an optional “tip”) fund our limited overhead costs and operational expenses and are leveraged to unlock additional people-powered philanthropic support.</p>",Organizations (B2B),"<p>Crowdfunded, people-to-people donations account over 70% of our revenue and will always remain a pillar of our model. On our platform, we’ve raised $16 million for patients, with an average donation of just $52 at a time. These funds allow us to serve as many patients as we can with the resources we have available at any given time — maximizing impact while ensuring fiscal health and sustainability. In addition, we strategically leverage grants and cryptocurrency donations to expand to reach new communities in need, test new and innovative patient care pathways, fund our minimal operating costs, and invest in other opportunities with a high probability of impact as they arise.</p>","<p>Watsi was founded in 2012 with the aim of using technology to fund healthcare. Our innovative crowdfunding platform creates a community where local medical teams and patients share their stories and raise money to directly fund their needed medical care. Watsi became the first non-profit to raise a “philanthropic seed round” of investment and was selected as the first nonprofit for the startup accelerator Y Combinator. Within Watsi’s first year, we’d processed $500,000 in donations and funded healthcare for 600 patients around the world, also closing our $1.2M Seed Funding Round shortly thereafter. In 2015, we closed our second funding round, a $3.5M Growth Fund, as we scaled and continued to hone the technology that connects everyday-funders directly to people in need of healthcare.

The challenge it addresses is substantial; annually, 17 million lives are lost to conditions that could be surgically treated. This stark figure is compounded by the fact that the cost of high-quality surgeries vastly exceeds the average monthly income in several low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), leaving safe surgery significantly underfunded and inaccessible for many, particularly in marginalized communities.

Watsi operates on a crowdfunding model where 100% of donations go directly toward funding surgical care. Embedded within local communities through partnerships with local medical facilities, Watsi has developed sustainable, locally-led programs responding to the most urgent healthcare needs of people in these regions. The organization focuses on the economic barriers within the health-poverty cycle, aiming to eliminate them at the point of care to prevent the exacerbation of poverty due to medical expenses. 

As of the submission, Watsi has mobilized over $16 million, aiding more than 25,000 individuals across 30 countries, with an average donation of $52. By integrating technology, Watsi ensures donors can directly fund a patient's treatment, subsequently receiving updates on the patient's post-surgery condition. This model of transparency and impact-focused operation embodies what Watsi refers to as ""radical transparency.""

The solution is positioned at the Pilot stage, indicating that the organization is currently testing its model with a smaller user base to refine and validate its effectiveness. Evidence of this development stage includes the significant amount of funding raised, the establishment of local medical partnerships, and the extensive number of patients already served. 

Watsi's team, led by Mackinnon Engen, benefits from vast experience in global health, humanitarian work across the UN, NGOs, and academic sectors, and a personal understanding of the importance of surgical care. The fully remote team operates globally, further emphasizing Watsi’s inclusive and expansive approach to solving health accessibility challenges.

The solution focuses on improving the accessibility and quality of health services for underserved groups in fragile contexts worldwide, aligning with several UN Sustainable Development Goals, including Good Health and Well-being, No Poverty, and Partnerships for the Goals. Watsi is seeking partners and support in areas including Business Model, Financial, Public Relations, and Technology to accelerate the creation of an Emergency Surgery Fund program, among other goals.

Incorporating diversity, equity, and inclusivity into their work, Watsi's team reflects a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and locations, underscoring their commitment to addressing global health disparities through technology and human connection."

The study further sought to assess the knowledge of couples at Guru Nanak Ramgharia Sikh Hospital regarding ABO and Rh incompatibility and their associated risks to mother and child. It was a retrospective study that involved a review of medical records of patients tested for ABO and Rhesus compatibility and incompatibility at Guru Nanak Ramgharia Sikh Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya between the years 1990 and 2022. The study further employed a cross-sectional design where 20 couples were randomly sampled and interviewed on their knowledge regarding with ABO and Rh incompatibility and its associated risks to mother and child. The study established that cases of ABO and Rh Incompatibility are prevalent. Regarding patients’ awareness of ABO and Rh incompatibility, the study found out that out of the 20 randomly sampled respondents, only seven respondents were aware of ABO and Rh Incompatibility and its associated risks to mother and child.

Moreover, the model proposes that when appropriate beliefs are held, the activation of health behavior is done by cues to action including a diverse range of triggers, such as individual perceptions of the disease, social influence, and health education campaigns or interventions. Finally, the model recognizes the general health motivation of individuals, or their concern about health matters (Abraham, 2016).</p>
<p>In other words, the Health Belief Model states that the individual’s action is influenced by their perception of the illness, either in the level of severity, the consequences, or the potential benefits of the action weighed against the physical, psychological, and financial costs in following the recommended action. The HBM is a means to identify perceptions of seriousness, susceptibility, benefits and barriers that can explain the need to engage in a particular  preventive behavior assuming that information related to the disease is accessible to everyone. However, the model recognizes behavior modifiers such as culture, education level, past experience, skills and motivation. </p><p>In its application to this solution, Health Belief Model enables our organization to individual perceptions of stillbirths and infant deaths.

It was motivated by a retrospective and cross-sectional study performed at Guru Nanak Ramgharia Sikh Hospital in Nairobi, revealing a significant lack of awareness among couples about ABO and Rh incompatibility risks. The study found that out of 20 couples sampled, only seven were aware of these risks, which can lead to spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality.

The solution aims to increase awareness of ABO and Rh incompatibility among couples in targeted communities. Activities include documentation of ABO and Rh incompatibility cases from maternity hospitals, analyzing the prevalence, and providing a database for these hospitals. The intended impact is to reduce maternal and newborn deaths attributed to incompatibility issues by leveraging community engagement through forums led by the organization, emphasizing local languages and cultural understanding.

The proposal states that the solution is at the prototype stage, having moved beyond conceptualization to engage with local communities and initiate awareness campaigns. This classification is substantiated by the organization's structured operations, existing data on Rhesus incompatibility, and prior community forums.

The organization, located in Machakos, Kenya, has already served 148 people. It seeks support from Solve to scale the solution nationally and develop a national Rhesus Data Bank to facilitate better access to compatibility information for maternity hospitals.

The solution addresses the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and is based on the Health Belief Model, focusing on threat perception and health-seeking behaviors. The technology used primarily involves SMS messages for communication with the target communities, chosen due to the widespread accessibility of mobile phones.

75739,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,"Excavo is a scalable learning management system that aligns content with immersive activities that activate social and emotional skill-building, creating wellness-supporting educational experiences for current and future healthcare workers that are supportive of their well-being and practice.","<p>COVID-19 changed the world permanently. </p>
<p>For medical students and healthcare workers specifically, it signaled a need to rethink how they prepare for the shocks and stresses that accompany the healthcare industry in an altering world.</p>
<p>On the frontlines contending with the illness were healthcare workers. In the United States, we lauded scenes in the media of critical care physicians and nurses in the thick of a tumultuousness that felt unfathomable to all who were tuned in. A snapshot of December 2020 shared by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reveals the unique stress the year posed for healthcare workers: over 100,000 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 nationwide, and nearly 200 U.S. hospitals were at total capacity, sending patients out of state. One-third of all hospitals reported no or limited space in their ICU unit.</p>
<p>Overburdened by mounting cases, nearly 1 in 5 healthcare workers left the field, citing the pandemic’s strain as their primary motivator. A 2020 Healthcare Worker Survey from Mental Health America reported that 93% of healthcare workers were experiencing stress, 86% were experiencing anxiety, 77% named frustration, 76% felt burnout, 75% said they were overwhelmed, and 68% reported work-related dread over the last three months. Nearly four in every ten shared that they lacked the emotional support to feel mentally healthy enough to perform their duties effectively.</p>
<p>The pandemic precipitated a national shortage in health care workers still felt today. It also dramatically shifted the medical school experience, creating a pipeline of candidates with a much different training experience than their predecessors. A TMS Collaborative survey revealed that nearly 8 out of 10 students felt a shift in their learning and how prepared they were for the next stage of their training. Nearly 75% reported that their confidence in performing clinical skills was affected.</p>
<p>Beyond the training gap caused by the disruption to medical education, the prolonged crisis posed challenges to the psychological well-being of medical students. In a cross-sectional study of 960 medical students issued at the height of the pandemic, 40.4% screened positive for anxiety, and 21.3% met the criteria for at least one dimension of burnout. Researchers from the University of Pikeville who conducted this study echoed the need many have put forth since—more protective factors for current and future healthcare workers.</p>
<p>A 2021 Mercer analysis of the U.S. healthcare labor market revealed that following the tireless nearly two-year face-off against COVID-19, the nation’s demand for healthcare workers would outpace supply by 2025 with the industry experiencing up to 3.2 million job vacancies, exacerbating the fragility of the U.S.’s still recovering healthcare system.</p>
<p>With Elsevier Health reporting that 47% of the U.S.’s current healthcare workforce is planning to leave their positions by then, a new way of doing and providing medical education that’s supportive of healthcare professional well-being and practice is urgently needed to sustain a sector vital to our collective functioning and prepare it for the next global emergency.</p>","<p><i>Excavo</i> is a learning management system (LMS) and simulation-authoring platform that animates scale case-based and problem-based learning approaches in medical education with play. Powered by iThrive Sim, the web-based tool allows medical experts to author content and pair it with social and emotional skill-building synergistically, creating relevant, accessible, and learner-focused educational experiences for current and future healthcare workers that support their well-being and practice.</p>
<p>Embodied learning, which happens when the mind and body are leveraged in the process, is one form of experiential learning. It centers the body as a source of knowledge and, therefore, deliberately enlists non-cognitive dimensions in learning to deepen it. iThrive Sim, the web-based application powering <i>Excavo</i>, facilitates embodied learning by leveraging the evocative power of tech-supported play to ignite social and emotional learning in any user from any sector and in any space where learning is happening.</p>
<p>Awarded for its inventiveness and responsiveness, iThrive Sim emerged as an ed-tech tool that powered connection-building and real-world applicable learning in virtual middle and high school classrooms at a time when young people and the educators who teach them were eager for disruption and novelty. The web-based application created a new digital space for teen collaborative learning and play in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and currently reaches classrooms and teens in 39 U.S. states.</p>
<p>On the backend of iThrive Sim is an authoring system that enables any subject matter expert to import rich content (text, graphics, videos, audio files, stand-alone resources, and third-party links) and create an engaging single-player or multiplayer role-playing simulation that’s tailored to the audience’s needs (i.e., reading level, preferred learning modality, language preferences, etc.). Using iThrive Sim’s synchronous and asynchronous information delivery mechanisms, admins individualize the information each end-user receives and personalize their learning journey, simulating the stress providers experience while making real-time decisions.</p>
<p><i>Excavo</i> brings iThrive Sim’s tech to the medical education space, facilitating the development of immersive, personalized learning experiences that are scaffolded with interactive opportunities that support self-regulation and self-management and have real-world applications in the shifting and fragile world healthcare workers navigate. The software captures in-game behaviors and improvised interactions shared with users and admins at the end of each simulation experience. An additive feature in the works will expand the software’s data collection and assessment capabilities, enabling more comprehensive reporting of users’ learning outcomes, real-time social and emotional functioning, and skill development.</p>","<p>The challenges impacting today's U.S. healthcare industry give us cues on what will be needed to support the impactful change that'll sustain it. Our tech-based solution seeks to meaningfully improve outcomes for current and future healthcare workers, the individuals and institutions tasked with training them, and the patients who benefit from a healthcare system that is protective of its professionals' social and emotional functioning.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey (ACS), the most recent count of the U.S. healthcare industry estimated 22 million workers, accounting for 14% of all workers in the country's labor force.</p>
<p>This number dropped during the pandemic, with many physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other healthcare workers quitting their jobs. COVID-19's impact on their psychological well-being and emotional functioning was named as a core motivator for leaving the profession. Stress remains the top reason why almost half of U.S. healthcare workers plan to go too by 2025. Thirty-nine percent said in a Mental Health America-administered survey that they did not feel they had adequate emotional support. </p>
<p><i>Excavo</i>, powered by iThrive Sim, addresses current health workers' need for more protective factors while on the job. Continuing medical education (CME) efforts will forever be a vital cog in bettering healthcare quality and improving patient outcomes. Our tech-based solution provides medical institutions and for-profit medical education a way to integrate the building of core, wellness-supporting social and emotional skills, like emotional regulation and stress management, meaningfully.</p>
<p>In states like New York, where the need for immediate care during the pandemic strained the training capacity of medical institutions, <i>Excavo</i> presents a new and innovative way to support meaningful self-directed learning in healthcare workers' continuing medical education, scaffolding their learning with practices supportive of their self-care, shown in a 2020 literature review to bolster healthcare professionals' well-being when integrated directly into clinical training programs and into the quality assurance processes of professional organizations. (Posluns &amp; Gall. 2020)</p>
<p>Students at medical schools also benefit from a real-world applicable and inventive way of learning about the field that honors their wholeness as people and their social-emotional needs as future healthcare workers. Data published in the BMC Medical Education in 2021 reported that of the first- to sixth-year students surveyed, many named classes without a didactic approach as a factor that worsened their quality of life. Conductors of the study went on to recommend medical schools' design curricula that connects their students with responsive psychological and pedagogical support (Tempski et al., 2012). Interventional studies have affirmed the same thing showing that social and emotional supports show promising effects on the self-care and academic adjustment of first-year medical students. However, more is needed to support them with long-term stressors. (Ball &amp; Bax, 2002)</p>
<p>Positive patient outcomes are inevitable when the ones tasked with caring for them are supported holistically in their practice. Integral to a healthy world is healthy and prepared healthcare workers.</p>","<p>As mothers, daughters, siblings, colleagues, and friends, each of us was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic—the abrupt disruption of life and the massive loss of it. Our proximity to healthcare workers starts with the simple truth that we are members of the same society, their labor sustained throughout this health emergency. Their work is vital, they are vital, and their health and well-being will always matter to us.</p>
<p>As social and emotional learning and mental health experts, we know the value of social and emotional skills in today's world, which is prone to shock and stress. We also recognize social and emotional skill development's role in its continued functioning and in supporting our collective well-being. Over the last six years, our team has built nuanced understandings in community with young people about what they need to thrive and integrated them, along with what we know about teen brain development, into compelling games, tools, and experiences, engineered with museums, nonprofits, and libraries that help teens question, shape, and explore new possibilities in themselves and the world. Each of these support their inquiry, imagination, meaning-making, resultantly—their social and emotional skills—factors proven to be protective of teen mental health. </p>
<p>We build on 30+ years of combined instructional and game design experience and an evidence-based, impact-oriented, accessibility-forward, and iterative approach to create these social and emotional health interventions. Core to our process is our co-design model with users, which is care in action. Recognizing that people are often defined by their vulnerabilities rather than the strengths they embody every day, our strength-based model of UX research makes clear that we cannot get to a world where every person  is valued, protected, proactively challenged, and cared for, without their unique needs centered and genius leading the way. </p>
<p>Titled 'Game Design Studio,' our UX research model creatively combines game design and design thinking activities with social and emotional ones. It revolutionizes the typical focus group with strategies that create a supportive context for discovery where everyone at the table feels safe, seen, and heard in relation to the issues they care about. Used so far with over 2,000 individuals and counting, it effectively gives the end-users of our wellness-supporting experiences a new modality for expressing their needs, concerns, and preferences before, during, and after the design process.</p>
<p>We know from our experiences with our UX research model  that the nuance that comes from co-creating elevates the efficacy of a solution, and the process itself is affirming for all who join in. Our team intends to take our co-design model and method to healthcare workers, past, current, and future ones, as well as the medical institutions tasked with training them, to arrive at a community-driven product. We have deliberately expanded our team to help us widen the net of healthcare professionals nationwide and extend the invitation to join in on the co-designing. We will use our UX research model, co-designing with at least 100 healthcare professionals and medical students, as we optimize Excavo.</p>","Increase local capacity and resilience in health systems, including the health workforce, supply chains, and primary care services","Newton, MA",United States,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone","<p>We have a working technology for a different market segment (secondary education); with this proposal we aim to adapt its content and functionality for the health care segment, a segment we are not currently serving.</p>",<p>3000+</p>,"<p>iThrive Sim, the core technology that powers <i>Excavo</i>, has successfully scaffolded learning with social and emotional skill-building.

Optimized to respond to the shift and disruption to education caused by the pandemic, the tech is personalized to respond to the pain points educators identified, like lack of student engagement and the needs teens expressed (i.e., connection, fun, and novelty). Since then, the tool has effectively done this for young people and educators not just in 38 states across the United States but for groups in nine other additional countries across six continents.</p>
<p>Our team is clear on how to build on iThrive Sim’s core tech to optimize <i>Excavo</i> and personalize it to address the pain points and UX/UI preferences shared by healthcare workers, medical students, and individuals at healthcare facilities tasked with supporting their medical education, new and continuing,</p>
<p>From this Solve MIT Global Challenge, we hope to gain strategic guidance and partnership to support our ongoing efforts to commercialize iThrive Sim’s technology in this sector and others where learning and training are happening. Mentorship from experts at Solve and MIT who are familiar with technological disruption and what it takes to bring forth new ways of doing and being in the world would greatly benefit our team. As a nonprofit, we hope to get to a licensing model that allows us to offset the costs of providing this valuable tool to educators for free and expanding it specifically for the benefit of the teens they teach.</p>
<p>As Solvers, we also hope to be in community with people across sectors who are thinking critically and consciously about the problems in tomorrow’s world and the solutions we can envision today to address them.

Additional research supports this finding adding that interventions that made workers feel in control and gave them meaningful opportunities to be heard yielded more reliable improvements in wellness. One rigorous meta-analysis showed that interventions that utilized team-based interventions, coping and communication skills training, and e-mental health approaches positively affected burnout reduction, however not all interventions showed impact (Fox et al., 2020).</p>
<p>The variance in the impact of these interventions reflects the myriad of factors, often localized to the workplace, that influence healthcare workers’ psychological well-being. It also serves as a reminder that while the additive wellness-supporting effects of one-time interventions support healthcare workers in the short term, achieving well-being sustainability throughout the healthcare workforce requires a prolonged effort. A task that is colossal and important to societal functioning requires a deliberate integration of the social and emotional into the culture of healthcare in the U.S. so that the wellness support of healthcare workers is never called an ‘intervention’ or an add-on, but rather viewed as a fundamental consideration in the industry. Medical education presents a viable means of ensuring that. </p>
<p>We see <i>Excavo</i> as a tool supportive of that necessary culture shift, hosting the learning vital to bettering healthcare professional practice in the same engine as the protective, social, and emotional skill-building needed to support healthcare workers’ capacity to recover from stressful and emotional events and innovate in their daily work. </p>
<p>Our tech-based solution, optimized in partnership with medical educators, will change how medical students and healthcare workers learn and train through their professional journey.</p>
<p>The tool enables the authoring of new medical education simulations, giving institutions, facilities, and schools ready to embrace participatory approaches with their personnel or student body a direct lever for co-creating with them. Responses solicited from a question like “How does stress typically show up in this medical case, in and outside the workplace?” are brought to life in each of the dynamic, media-rich simulations <i>Excavo</i> enables admins to create, allowing end-users to contend with educational content in a simulated context that mirrors the triggers, shocks, and stressors they see in their profession. By supporting social and emotional skill-building—an evidence-based factor supportive of mental health through embodied learning, <i>Excavo</i> directly addresses a pervasive underlying cause for healthcare worker turnout. This, in turn, supports positive impacts on patient outcomes and alleviates the operational costs that accompany the turnover that often follows healthcare worker burnout and currently costs the average U.S. hospital $5.2 million and $9 million per year for the loss of registered nurses (RN) alone (NSI National Health Care Retention &amp; RN Staffing Report, 2023).</p>","<p>Our team is focused on product optimization over the next year. We aim to engage a diverse group of more than 100 healthcare professionals and medical students in optimizing <i>Excavo</i>, iteratively testing and fine-tuning the tech-based solution to reflect their feedback and wisdom. To reach this goal, we have onboarded two new consultants to our team to support our network-building efforts. Each has been trained in our values, co-design approach, and design principles, collectively supportive of active listening, knowledge-building, and knowledge-sharing. <br /></p>
<p>On the impact end, we aim to have our co-designing with healthcare workers culminate with the development of a social and emotional skill-building learning management system (LMS) that meaningfully supports the training of healthcare workers at medical institutions and students at medical schools across the country. <i>Excavo</i> presents a new medical education method by scaffolding educational content with social and emotional skill-building activities and facilitating immersive experiences that build on practical case-based and problem-based learning approaches. With the tool optimized to effectively support the development of social and emotional skills proven to help mental health outcomes, we hope to see an increase in social and emotional learning outcomes at medical institutions across the country. To reach this goal, our team intends to scale the impact of <i>Excavo</i> through partnership with companies already well-positioned in the medical education space, namely the ones already thinking innovatively about how to best deliver high-quality educational programming that elicits demonstrable outcomes and supports workers’ well-being.</p>
<p>In the next five years, we hope to see <i>Excavo</i> widely distributed across the country and support patient outcomes in underserved areas currently experiencing the most intensive effects of healthcare workforce turnover. The 2022 NSI National Health Care Retention &amp; RN Staffing Report, which assessed over 730,000 healthcare workers and registered nurses from 272 facilities in 32 states, estimated the national hospital turnover rate to be 22.7%. Research has long established that higher rates of healthcare workforce turnover are associated with higher patient mortality, lower patient satisfaction, and adverse patient outcomes (Aboagye et al., 2014; Geno Tai et al., 2021; Hall, 2005; Vaughan &amp; Edwards, 2020; Vikas et al., 2015). One study has even shared that with the loss of one nurse, patient infections increase by roughly 30 percent. As a tool that supports healthcare workers in building emotional resilience and managing shocks and stress, <i>Excavo</i> will meaningfully add to the ecosystem of support healthcare workers deserve and require to provide ongoing patient-centered care.</p>
<p>Tangentially, since the revenue generated from the licensed use of <i>Excavo</i> will offset the cost of developing iThrive Sim-powered simulations for teens, the uptake of this product will help facilitate the authoring of more dynamic social and emotional learning experiences for young people in schools and in teen-serving spaces across the U.S., connecting them with a tool that helps them sharpen a protective factor vital to teen mental health.</p>","3. Good Health and Well-being, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth","<p>Over the next nine months, progress for our team will be measured by the number of co-design sessions with representative groups of healthcare workers and medical students and the survey responses they share afterward. </p>
<p>In addition to collecting user input through design artifacts and field notes through the co-design session, at the end of our co-design sessions with end users, we ask participants to share their reflections using qualitative surveys methodologies. Devised to be as much of a social and emotional learning experience as a UX research-centered one, our co-design model facilitates a wellness-supporting experience that enables active listening and affirms participants' strengths. We intend to assess the data they share through surveys to track and measure the impact of this vital process that will get us to a community-driven product. Our team, skilled in outcome and process evaluation, will use affinity mapping to assess this aggregate data for common themes to report on the impact of the participatory process.</p>
<p>Data collection capabilities on the back end of <i>Excavo</i> through its core iThrive Sim tech allow us to gather essential demographics and outcome data to measure progress toward our impact goals. </p>
<p><i>Excavo</i> will assign each user registered on the platform a unique identifier that allows us to measure uptake and use. Users will also be able to share vital information about their affiliated medical institution or medical school, including zip codes, academic year, or profession (title, number of years teaching, etc.). Pursuant of the tool's goal to meaningfully support healthcare worker well-being, <i>Excavo</i> will collect indicators of each end user's real-time social and emotional functioning, measuring and reporting their improvement with each simulation they interface. A personalized report of this data will be accessible on each user's dashboard.</p>
<p>Vital demographic data coupled with outcome data on healthcare workers' social and emotional learning enables us to compare the geographical density of <i>Excavo</i>’s use with patient outcomes in zip codes nationwide.</p>
<p>With the tool's ability to quickly generate reports of social and emotional learning outcomes at the individual user, hospital-wide, and at the zip code level, our team will be able to share valuable insights with relevant state institutions thinking critically on how to personalize solutions to the healthcare worker burnout and turnover challenge that's exacerbating the United States' already fragile health infrastructure.</p>
<p>With the uptake of <i>Excavo</i> directly supporting teen social and emotional learning by offsetting the cost of an expanded free simulation library, we intend to continue leveraging iThrive Sim's tech to help young people's social and emotional skill development in all academic and recreational contexts. Our tech currently measures progress toward this goal by gauging real-time social and emotional functioning and guiding teen-serving adults as simulation facilitators through pre- and post-simulation activities and assessments.</p>","<p>Elevating the importance of social and emotional learning in the U.S. healthcare sector has immense potential to support it in confronting a pervasive factor underscoring workover turnover—burnout caused by psychological stress. </p>
<p>Healthcare workers have always been vital to the functioning of society and are leaving the sector at such an alarming rate that demand for healthcare workers will outpace supply by 2025 (Mercer, US Healthcare Labor Market, 2021). Studies report that the poor mental health experienced by healthcare workers is underlying much of this turnover (Willard-Grace et al., 2019; Bae, 2023).</p>
<p>The impact this has had on patients' health outcomes has been felt in U.S. states experiencing the highest turnover rates. It has restrained healthcare access and patient choice and elevated the incidence of patient infections and mortality (Bae et al., 2010; Warshawsky et al., 2013; Castle, 2010; Luther, 2017). An estimated 6.5 million healthcare workers plan to leave by 2026, exacerbating the sector's current fragility (Mercer, US Healthcare Labor Market, 2021). The 2021 GHS Index estimates that the United States ranks the U.S. healthcare system's medical countermeasures and personnel deployment at 50, indicating that the country's healthcare sector's workforce is dangerously unprepared for future epidemic and pandemic threats. </p>
<p>As social and emotional learning experts, our team is uniquely positioned to strengthen the social and emotional skills healthcare workers need. Studies have long proven that the continual practice of these skills protects well-being and supports emotional resilience. </p>
<p>To understand the social and emotional skill gaps that exist in the healthcare workforce and the way it shows up in their practice and profession, our team is working toward engaging a representative sample of healthcare professionals and medical students in a co-design process that will thoughtfully explore their lived experiences and pain points. Affinity mapping the insights from these trauma-informed co-design sessions will support us in developing an optimized output—Excavo. Studies show that participatory models similar to our co-design one directly support the efficacy of interventions and programs (Quinlan, 2009; Shire et al., 2019; Gray et al., 2016).</p>
<p>As a lever for dynamic medical education, Excavo will help healthcare workers sharpen wellness-supporting skills, like stress management and responsible decision-making, while learning content vital to their practice. We plan to scale the impact of Excavo through partnerships with companies and institutions already well-positioned in the healthcare sector to reach as many workers as possible.</p>
<p>Research shows that when adults consistently practice social and emotional skills, they experience better mental health. When they have these protective factors, they are less likely to experience burnout—a widely reported cause of healthcare workforce turnover (Gabriel &amp; Aguinis, 2022; Görgens-Ekermans &amp; Brand, 2012). Less burned-out healthcare workers translate to a better-staffed healthcare sector equipped to handle the next health emergency. </p>
<p>Our theory of change is more than a product. It disrupts medical education with the reminder that emotions have a place in learning and that by supporting social and emotional skill development at all entry points for learning in the healthcare sector, we fortify it as a whole.</p>","<p>The iThrive Sim platform at the core of <i>Excavo</i> leverages the transformative power of social and emotional learning—an evidence-based practice proven to support emotional resilience to stress and positive mental health outcomes. </p>
<p>These skills are all buildable ones and iThrive Sim supports the deliberate practice of them while healthcare workers and medical students contend with educational content, so they are always actively strengthening a factor protective to their psychological well-being while they learn.</p>
<p>iThrive Sim is written in AWS Lambda and uses a GraphQL API. Front-end development was done using HTML, CSS and the VueJS framework and backend development was done with Python 3.7 and MySQL enabling easy and streamlined creation and customization of new simulations. The tech specs support the creation of interactive learning experiences that offer dynamic opportunities to engage deeply with learning materials typically folded into the online modular approaches embraced by many medical education and continuing medical education programs. </p>
<p>Through the tool’s dynamic authoring platform, admins can personalize simulations to the needs of  in-person, online, and hybrid environments (i.e., reading level, preferred learning modality, language preferences, etc.). Using iThrive Sim’s synchronous and asynchronous information delivery mechanisms, admins individualize the information each end-user receives and personalize their learning journey, simulating the stress healthcare workers experience when making decisions in their practice while leveraging the merits of case-based and problem-based learning approaches.</p>
<p>Designed to be universalized and user-friendly, the iThrive Sim utilizes HTTP requests to allow anyone to immediately begin using the software despite firewalls, supporting its accessibility by learners everywhere. Building on this current version, we are tailoring the iThrive Sim platform in community with those it will serve and support, optimizing it to be future compatible. </p>
<p>The simulations built with <i>Excavo</i> via the iThrive Sim platform support immersive role-play that’s synergistic with the best way healthcare professionals learn, prompting them on the user end to engage in critical, urgent decision-making with timed decisions, weighted voting, and consequences. The ability to create single-player or multiplayer ones also gives admins the power to create connection-building, tech-supported learning experiences, or self-directed ones that workers’ can engage with on their own time. </p>
<p>User-created content and decisions are captured on admin, facilitator, and user-facing dashboards, as well as metrics that measure learning progress.

Historically, our team’s revenue has come from a combination of grants from private foundations, fee-for-service contracts from government agencies, foundations, and co-creation contracts with other educational companies.</p>
<p>Going forward, we will continue to generate revenue for the nonprofit’s impact goals through grants, design service contracts, and co-creation contracts as we restructure iThrive Games as more of a hybrid. We will continue operating the nonprofit to support its work with foundations and other youth-serving nonprofits and to house the intellectual property living within the iThrive Sim platform. We intend to create a separate, independent for-profit corporation that will operate as our primary operating company and be responsible for executing fees for service contracts, housing employees, and licensing iThrive Sim’s intellectual property. </p>
<p>This structure will allow our team the flexibility to continue generating revenue through grants and contracts for our game design services and products, as well as our thought leadership to foundations and grantors making philanthropic contributions while growing our for-profit customer base. The for-profit arm of our organization will generate recurring revenue with design and co-design contracts with larger companies, as well as contract revenue for design and product delivery and recurring iThrive Sim platform fees from adjacent market customers such as workforce development and professional certification curriculum providers seeking engaging simulation tools to deliver measurable outcomes for their users in areas such as social and emotional skill development and well-being. We are also investigating the feasibility of earning recurring revenue where we could charge a small platform maintenance fee each time the simulations are utilized by licensees. Creating a for-profit arm will enable us to grow our organization by raising capital from the numerous investors who have inquired about investing after seeing iThrive Sim in the market.</p>
<p>Since our inception in 2017, we have received a total of $4.55 million in philanthropic gifts, $1.69 million in grant revenue and $1 million in design contract revenue for a total of $7.24 million in revenue. </p>
","<p>iThrive Games' revenue has been generated primarily through grants. We were created through a financial partnership with DN Batten Foundation, whose focus on adolescent well-being and innovation dovetailed with iThrive Games' expertise in adolescent wellness and gaming. The synergy led to the building of iThrive Sim as a lever for supporting young people at a time when social distancing orders limited how remote learning was done. </p><p>In addition, iThrive has successfully generated grant revenue from the William T Grant Foundation, who awarded us a $394,133 grant to use design thinking with Black youth in the juvenile justice system to address mental health inequities; the National Endowment for the Humanities, who awarded us a $250,022 grant to develop game-based humanities education for distance learning for high school students; The Reagan Foundation and The National Archives, who collectively awarded us $191,000 to develop Civics simulations, and the XQ Institute, who awarded us a $26,000 grant to support design and planning of new transformational learning experiences for high school students. </p>
<p>Through these grants, iThrive Games has been able to build award-winning immersive learning experiences that have delivered outstanding measurable outcomes.  </p>
<p>We have also successfully generated revenue from contracts with federal government agencies, other educational non-profits, and foundations. In 2021, the Federal Emergency Management Agency contracted our team to co-design a role-playing scenario on the iThrive Sim platform that promotes teen emergency preparedness.

Excavo is designed to address the significant mental health challenges and training gaps faced by healthcare workers, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The system integrates social and emotional skill-building with educational content, providing an immersive, personalized learning experience for current and future healthcare workers. This approach aims to support wellness, reduce burnout, and improve practice within the healthcare industry.

As of now, the development stage of the proposed solution is classified as Prototype. This classification is based on the information that iThrive Sim, the underpinning technology for Excavo, is already operational in a different market segment (secondary education) but needs adaptation for healthcare education. The proposal indicates that while the core technology exists and has been applied successfully in other contexts, its content and functionality require modification to serve the healthcare sector effectively, which the team is yet to begin serving.

Excavo is intended to serve a wide range of stakeholders within the U.S. healthcare system, including medical students, healthcare workers, medical institutions, and patients indirectly. The solution aims to address the widespread issue of healthcare worker burnout by offering education that incorporates stress management and emotional regulation, ultimately contributing to a more resilient healthcare workforce. Given the anticipated shortage of healthcare workers and the high rate of burnout and turnover within the sector, Excavo seeks to provide a critical intervention.

The development team is comprised of experts in social and emotional learning and mental health, leveraging six years of experience in creating tools and experiences that support well-being. The team has proposed a co-design model to involve healthcare professionals, students, and medical institutions in the development process, ensuring the product meets the specific needs of its end-users. This participatory approach underscores the commitment to creating a user-centered and community-driven product.

In terms of impact, the proposal outlines goals for both the next year and the following five years. These include engaging healthcare professionals and students in the product development process, optimizing Excavo for use in medical education, and expanding the tool's reach to support healthcare workers nationwide. The ultimate aim is to contribute to a more sustainable healthcare system by addressing the underpinning issues of stress and burnout among healthcare workers.

To measure progress toward these impact goals, the proposal outlines plans for qualitative surveys and feedback from co-design sessions, as well as quantitative data collection through the platform. The methodology includes tracking user engagement, demographic information, and social and emotional learning outcomes to assess the effectiveness of the solution in improving healthcare education and workforce well-being.

Overall, the solution offers an innovative approach to medical education by focusing on the integration of social and emotional learning into healthcare training, aiming to address the critical issue of healthcare worker well-being in the context of a challenging and ever-evolving global healthcare landscape."
75966,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,A mobile patient feedback platform which connects the voices of citizens to decision makers across the healthcare system.,"<p>Improvements in health outcomes in the Global South, including preventable deaths, are constrained by the low-quality delivery of public health services. This is in part attributable to lack of resources. However, a key challenge in many contexts is also limited information and weak accountability relationships within the health system. In Tanzania the outcome is that there are 11,000 maternal and 100,000 under-5 deaths per year. Moreover, the rate of maternal mortality is 50% higher than in neighboring Kenya.</p>
<p>Within the healthcare system in Tanzania there are inadequate citizen feedback channels. The typical facility receives just two pieces of citizen feedback per month - typically via paper and pen through suggestion boxes. 60% of citizens say that existing feedback mechanisms are inadequate. As a result, citizens' voices are insufficiently heard within the system. </p>
<p>Consequently there is a lack of accurate, timely, and low-cost information about the needs of citizens and the performance of health service providers. This means even when the system has the resources to address its problem citizens, healthcare workers and government officials struggle to advocate for resources and implement high quality healthcare services. These issues can be broken down for three different groups of stakeholders within the healthcare system:</p>
<p>Citizens and communities:</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Bottom-up accountability</b>: Citizens and communities can not systematically hold service providers to account</p></li><li><p><b>Trust</b>: Citizens and communities underutilize key healthcare services due to a lack of trust in the quality of services</p></li></ul><p>Healthcare workers:</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Challenge and solution identification</b>: Healthcare workers have limited ability to understand the real-time challenges of citizens and so prioritize and develop suitable solutions </p></li><li><p><b>Motivation: </b>Healthcare workers have limited motivation to address citizen challenges as they have inadequate information to develop solutions</p></li><li><p><b>Resource allocation</b>: Healthcare workers can not effectively advocate for the resources they need to implement solutions</p></li></ul><p>Government officials<em> (both local to national government):</em></p>
<ul><li><p><b>Challenge and solution identification</b>: Government officials have limited ability to understand citizens’ challenges and to prioritize and develop suitable solutions or policies for the services they support and the health system overall</p></li><li><p><b>Motivation: </b>Government officials have limited motivation to address citizen challenges as they have inadequate information to develop solutions</p></li><li><p><b>Resource allocation</b>: Government officials have limited information to ensure they allocate resources in line with these solutions and policies</p></li><li><p><b>Top-down accountability</b>: Government officials have limited ability to systematically monitor through readily available information the performance of the healthcare system (at different levels of aggregation)</p></li></ul><p><br /></p>","<p>Our innovation is a mobile citizen feedback service. After receiving healthcare services, citizens provide feedback, using free SMS and USSD surveys through their own phones (accessible to 85% of the population), on the quality of services they received. These surveys are triggered by citizens themselves and the platform is promoted within communities via printed, radio and community healthcare worker led campaigns. This data is analyzed and provided to healthcare workers and government officials in the form of easy to use alerts, dashboards and quality reports. The platform provides healthcare workers and officials with (1) large volumes of real-time, facility specific insights on the quality of services provided, (2) tools to support the selection of suitable solutions and (3) accountability prompts to encourage the use of the data and track the implementation of solutions. Together these components drive responsive and accountable decision making. Lastly, feedback summaries and information updates are provided back to citizens to close the feedback loop, to ensure they are well informed and to build trust in the system.</p>
<p>Compared to the dominant, existing feedback mechanisms (such as suggestion boxes) a mobile platform addresses barriers for citizens as they can provide feedback anonymously and reduces the literacy barrier to providing feedback relative to paper and pen options. For the government, the intervention increases the volume of feedback collected and enables it to be analyzed in real-time in a systematic way to enable evidence-based decision-making at all levels of the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Feedback data is collected across several domains of the <a href=""https://www.ahrq.gov/talkingquality/measures/six-domains.html"">IOM’s framework of care quality</a>, including; (i) patient-centered care, (ii) effectiveness, (iii) timeliness, (iv) efficiency, (v) safety, and (vi) equity. After the data is collected it is analyzed to identify priority problems and integrated into existing government health information systems. The use of data is promoted through existing quality improvement and performance management processes at three levels of the healthcare system: community level (through social dialogues, community notice boards, community radio broadcasts), health facility levels (through quality improvement meetings and health facility governing committee meetings) and local government level (through supportive supervisions and quarterly budgeting and resourcing meetings). </p>
<p>The program drives top-down accountability by ensuring strong buy-in and ownership of the program among local government officials who oversee healthcare workers.

<p>Afya Pamoja has been working with Tanzania’s Ministry of Health and Ministry of Local Government since 2021 to co-design and test citizen feedback platforms and has established strong partnerships with these institutions which are formalised through a signed 5-year MOU, a research protocol approved by the National Institute of Medical Research and a government project document outlining the program’s operations and pathway to national scale over the next 5 years. Through this process Afya Pamoja and the Government have established a shared vision for how to design, test and scale a citizen feedback platform in the healthcare sector. </p>
<p>In June 2022, Afya Pamoja launched a digital client feedback platform in 135 facilities in Dodoma Region of central Tanzania. Over the last 9 months the team have tested a variety of program innovations in order to deeply understand how feedback services can drive improvements in quality of service delivery. This has enabled Afya Pamoja’s program team to spend extensive time with users of the service, including clients who provide feedback as well as healthcare workers and local government officials who use the data for decision-making. Afya Pamoja have a unique insight into how to design this service for each of the key stakeholder groups in order to maximise its impact potential. </p>
<p>Through the partnerships established with the Government, the experience of launching and implementing a client feedback service, and with a skilled team dedicated to this mission, Afya Pamoja is uniquely well-positioned to implement these activities. </p>

<p>Dr. Helga Mutasingwa, Director of Partnerships is a Tanzanian doctor and public healthcare professional with 10 years of experience. Prior to co-founding Afya Pamoja, she managed ICAP’s HIV-patient retention program in the Dar es Salaam Region, visiting public healthcare facilities, patients, facility staff and local government health monitoring teams on a daily basis. She has a deep, personal understanding of the challenges faced by the Tanzanian healthcare system due to lack of feedback, and has a strong network throughout government. She was awarded an Echoing Green fellowship for her work with Afya Pamoja.

Currently the voices of the vast majority of Tanzanians cannot be heard, and their experience of healthcare services is hard to understand. Afya Pamoja partners with the Government of Tanzania by putting citizens' voices at the centre of government decision-making. </p>
<p>Through our platform, using free SMS surveys patients’ provide feedback, through their own phones, on the services they received at a healthcare facility. This data is analyzed and provided to healthcare workers and government officials in the form of easy to use alerts, dashboards and quality reports. The service provides healthcare staff with large volumes of real-time, facility specific and actionable insights on the quality of services provided to drive responsive and accountable decision making. Lastly, updates are provided back to patients to close the feedback loop and build trust. </p>
<p>Insights are provided on the availability of services (such as those required during antenatal care visits) and the quality of services (such as family planning guidance). Healthcare workers can then identify and address the needs of patients in a systematic manner through supportive performance management tools. Government health officials can also identify service challenges (such as healthcare worker attendance) and gaps and so divert support (such as audits) and resources to these issues. </p>
<p>Compared to existing feedback mechanisms (such as suggestion boxes) a mobile service addresses barriers for patients and government. For patients it resolves the key fear around anonymity and reduces the literacy barrier to providing feedback relative to paper and pen options. For the government, the innovation increases the volume of feedback collected and enables it to be analysed in real-time in a systematic way and directed to multiple levels of the healthcare system. The solution includes a level of flexibility such that healthcare managers can collect data on specific issues as and when they need, receiving specific information on their highest priority issues. Lastly, to ensure adoption and sustainability, data is integrated into existing government health information systems and insights directed through existing performance management processes (such as monthly district oversight meetings).</p>

<p>In Q1 2023 we completed a 9-month pilot focused on clients receiving care in the RCH space, which has provided evidence for the impact of our program. Over the next 12 months we are working with the Government of Tanzania on designing a new program that will enable all clients to provide feedback regardless of the type of care they have received. </p>
<p>Currently we operate in 150 healthcare facilities in two districts in Dodoma Region. These 150 facilities serve a catchment population of approximately 1 million people. By the end of 2023 we have aligned with the Government that we will be operating in 500 facilities across 10 districts, which in turn provide healthcare services to 3.2 million people. By the end of 2024 we expect to be operating in 1,000 healthcare facilities which provide healthcare services to 6.4 million people.</p>
<p>In order to achieve our goal of scaling the program nationally we will follow a phased approach supported by a coalition of funders focused on scaling evidenced-based interventions. The RCT that we will launch in 2024 will be a key step by (1) providing evidence for the government about why this intervention is valuable, (2) providing evidence to support future fundraising activities, (3) how to scale the platform cost effectively across multiple regions of the country. </p>
<p><a href=""https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/2/1145/5996193"">Christensen 2021</a> finds that community feedback can result in 38% reductions in infant under-5 mortality. By replicating the impact of this study nationwide our program would reduce deaths by approximately 40,000 per annum, not accounting for other sources of deaths such as maternal mortality. This is equivalent to 4 lives saved per facility (10,000 across the whole country) at an average cost-per-life saved of 750 EUR, making it among the most cost-efficient life-saving interventions. The charity research organization Givewell estimates <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charithttps://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charitiesies/top-charities"">top-performing charities</a> can save a life for between $3,000-$5,000. We will initially focus on public sector facilities which are disproportionately used by those of lower socioeconomic status and by women, so we expect the greatest impact to be realised among these segments of the population. <br /></p>
<p>To achieve this scale our major partners are Tanzania’s Ministry of Health and Ministry of Local Government with whom we have a strong relationship and vision alignment for this service. We have signed a 5-year MOU with the government to design and scale digital client feedback services in partnership with both ministries. We also have been formally approved to conduct Implementation Research on client feedback systems in Tanzania through the National Institute of Medical Research and are currently finalising a formal project document with both ministries which outlines the operational plan for how we will design, test and scale this service nationally over the next 5 years. We work closely with 5 director-level champions across both ministries. </p>","3. Good Health and Well-being, 16. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions","<p>Our intervention is a health systems strengthening program which focuses on improving quality of care. We expect to see changes in the behaviour and knowledge of clients and healthcare workers, changes in quality of care indicators and changes in ultimate healthcare outcomes. </p>
<p>There are two phases of our program measurement, internal and external.<br /></p>
<p>Internal: In order to monitor our program performance, our internal M&amp;E team will follow a routine monthly data collection process. The team collects a combination of quantitative and qualitative data based on an M&amp;E framework which identifies indicators based on our Theory of Change. This enables us to track changes in indicators over time and compare baseline to endline readings. The indicators (not exhaustive) are listed in the table below.</p>
<p>Quantitative data comes from a range of sources including the digital platform itself and digital surveys issued to healthcare workers on a monthly basis. This data is collected from all facilities where the program is live. Qualitative data comes from monthly interviews with all program stakeholders including users of the platform, healthcare workers and local government officials. These are randomly sampled each month.</p>
<p>External: We will launch the RCT in Q1 2024 and run for 12 months. The study will involve 1,000 health facilities from 50 districts and their catchment’s areas. We are designing this RCT in collaboration with world-leading academics from Tanzania and the US. </p>
<p>Indicators: monitored include the following:</p>
<p><em>Platform adoption</em> </p>

<p>Activities:</p>
<p>Through our program we collect large volumes of citizen feedback through our SMS technology platform. During our pilot clients perceived variable service quality by facility and by domain of care quality, indicating that feedback data is a valuable signal. Feedback data is shared at all levels of the healthcare system, and our pilot demonstrated that this is feasible.</p>
<p>Pathways:</p>
<p>#1 - Citizens and communities:</p>
<p>Citizen feedback interventions build stronger relationships and trust between citizens and healthcare workers and government officials (<a href=""https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5407-8"">Danhoundo 2018</a>, <a href=""https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2385-5"">Mselle 2019</a>). This leads to increased utilisation of services. </p>
<p>After 6 months of our pilot, 71% of interviewed mothers who had used the feedback platform reported increased trust in the healthcare system and there was a 5.2 percentage point increase in institutional births relative to control districts (differences in differences analysis). Other research shows a 20% increase in utilisation of ANC visits (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27190223/"">Gullo 2016</a>).</p>
<p>#2 - Healthcare workers:</p>
<p>Citizen feedback data improves facility healthcare workers’ understanding of citizens’ needs and increases the motivation of healthcare workers to improve quality. During our pilot we observed that the % of total facilities conducting QI meetings increased by 32 percentage points from program launch to six months later. During interviews, healthcare workers described using feedback data to write QI action plans.</p>
<p>#3 - Government officials<em>:</em></p>
<p>Sharing data with local government officials (i) improves understanding of performance issues, (ii) increases their ability to hold facilities to account and (iii) improves the efficiency of resource allocation among facilities. </p>
<p>Studies (<a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w27678"">Callen 2020</a>) find that providing data to public healthcare managers increases facility audit visits by 104% and doctor attendance by 75%. This improves resource allocations (e.g. medicines) and staff behaviours. Evidence suggests it can increase availability of essential medicines by 41% (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27784594/"">Blake 2016</a>).</p>
<p>Outcomes: </p>
<p>From these pathways we expect to observe changes in stakeholder knowledge and behaviour and improved quality of care and healthcare outcomes. Key indicators include:</p>
<ul><li><p>Behaviour and knowledge:</p><ul><li><p>Citizen trust in healthcare services and knowledge of healthcare rights</p></li><li><p>Citizens’ willingness to provide feedback </p></li><li><p>Healthcare worker and local government officials’ correct identification of citizens’ reported priority challenges</p></li><li><p>Volume of healthcare worker quality improvement meetings, action plans created and issues resolved</p></li><li><p>Volume of local government oversight activities (e.g. supportive supervisions), action plans created and issues resolved</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Healthcare quality:</p><ul><li><p>Facility infrastructure (e.g. cleanliness) </p></li><li><p>Availability of inputs (e.g. HIV testing kits)</p></li><li><p>Healthcare worker attendance </p></li><li><p>Waiting times</p></li><li><p>Customer service (e.g. disrespectful language)</p></li><li><p>Corruption</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Healthcare outcomes </p><ul><li><p>This will include near-term metrics including utilisation of care (e.g. ANC attendance) and ultimate outcomes including infant and maternal mortality rates and morbidity rates for malaria and HIV. Research shows that citizen engagement can reduce infant mortality by 38% (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1162%2Fqjec.2009.124.2.735"">Bjorkmann &amp; Svensson 2009</a>, <a href=""http://odube.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ebola-Sierra-Leone-QJE.pdf"">Christensen et al 2021</a>)</p></li></ul></li></ul>","<p>The main part of our digital client feedback platform is based around SMS technology. We use an open-sourced SMS platform called RapidPro which enables us to design and manage the content of the system. The SMS or USSD prompts are sent to the clients who register to the platform and their responses are also aggregated within the RapidPro system. This aggregated data is then sent through an API to the government's healthcare information management system where it can be analysed and viewed by different users of that system, healthcare workers and government staff. </p>
<p>We selected this design for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul><li>Accessibility - 85% of Tanzanians have access to a simple phone which has USSD and SMS technology and thus by choosing to design our system using this technology, it is widely-accessible to our target user population. </li><li>Cost - SMS and USSD technology is a relatively low-cost form of technology which means that the system is scalable and called feasibly become a nationally-scaled system. </li><li>Sustainability - Integrating our technology system into the government's healthcare information system helps to build the long-term sustainability and government buy-in for the service. </li></ul>",A new application of an existing technology,,Software and Mobile Applications,Tanzania,"India,Tanzania",Nonprofit,,"7 full-time staff, 4 part-time staff",2 years,"<p>Afya Pamoja is committed to building a team and organisational culture on the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion. </p>

There is high demand from the Government of Tanzania for this service given that it can support quality improvement initiatives at the community, facility and local government levels, and policy initiatives at the central government level. For citizens the service is free-of-charge, and provides them with a free-to-use, user-friendly platform for providing their feedback. 60% of citizens state that current feedback services are inadequate, yet 75% of citizens express a desire to provide feedback. </p>
<p>The overall value proposition is based on the impact of the feedback service on healthcare outcomes. This is a healthcare systems strengthening intervention which can drive improved quality of care and experience of care for citizens. Afya Pamoja's service will be the first in Tanzania to provide large volumes of real-time, structured data. This data is used to drive decisions at multiple levels of the healthcare system, from the community level, to facility and local government level, leading to improved healthcare outcomes such as reduced maternal mortality.      </p>
<p>We are a grant funded non-profit. We receive grants from three types of funders which we use to support different parts of our work. (1) Innovation / research funders (e.g. Fund for Innovation in Development, J-PAL) to support innovation and evaluation work, (2) multilateral organizations (e.g. UNICEF) to support our implementation activities across new regions and (3) Foundations / Individuals (e.g. Echoing Green) who provide unrestricted funding to support organizational capacity development and overheads. In 2021 we raise $145k in grant funding and in 2022 $600k. Our funders require us to demonstrate our impact by running robust program M&amp;E and sharing regular reports. Given the low-cost nature of our program, and the high impact potential, we believe this represents great value-for-money when compared against alternative public health investments.

The results of this RCT will support us to raise additional funding by providing a strong evidence base for our work. </p>",Government (B2G),"<p>At national-scale we project based on our unit costs that it will require 4 million USD per annum to run our program. Our goal is to secure this from three major sources: (i) 25% from government cost-sharing arrangements (for core implementation costs), (ii) 50% from long-term bi-/multilateral development partner commitments, and (iii) 25% from global health donors motivated by evidence based and cost effective interventions.<br /></p><p>This excludes additional subsidized expenses to cover the on-going SMS costs  The Ministry of Health has already gained access to a fully-subsidized SMS communication line with zero costs for SMS and USSD. They have expressed interest in approving the feedback service to be implemented using this asset which would increase our level of government ownership. <br /></p><p>Government cost-sharing: There is increasing willingness from the Government to provide increased budget allocations for digital health solutions, given the increase in access to technology among citizens. Once the evidence-base for the program is clearly established government will cover the core implementation costs such as healthcare worker and local government incentives. We have seen other digital health organisations who have been able to achieve this, such as M-Mama in Tanzania, and Jacaranda Health in Kenya.     </p><p>Bi/Multi-lateral development partners: 50% of healthcare spending in Tanzania comes from these partners. Typically these partners fund multi-year commitments or key parts of the nation's healthcare infrastructure. There is an established Working Group for these organisations which meets quarterly. Given our strong partnership with the Government, senior officials would advocate for these partners to fund the scaling of the client feedback program through Afya Pamoja. </p><p>Global health donors and foundations: This funding would come from a range of foundations, from large global health donors (e.g. Gates) which would support long-term program scaling and smaller family foundations, such as the Big Bang Philanthropy Group, who provide unrestricted, highly flexible funding which would support the core team.</p>","<p>To-date we have cumulatively raised $800,000 of funding to support our work.

This solution stems from the critical issue of preventable deaths in the Global South, notably in Tanzania, where the challenge is compounded by not just a lack of resources but significantly by inadequate citizen feedback channels within the healthcare system. The annual statistics presented highlight the grave situation: 11,000 maternal and 100,000 under-5 deaths, partly due to the system's inability to efficiently gather and act on citizen feedback.

The solution utilizes SMS and USSD technology, which is accessible to 85% of the population. This technology facilitates anonymous feedback from citizens, overcoming barriers presented by traditional feedback mechanisms like suggestion boxes. Moreover, the solution integrates the feedback into existing government health information systems to inform decision-making processes at different healthcare system levels, aiming to improve the quality and equity of healthcare services.

This initiative is currently in the Growth stage, with evidence of its deployment in 135 facilities across Dodoma Region, Central Tanzania, serving a catchment population of approximately 1 million people. The organization behind this proposal, Afya Pamoja, demonstrates strong ties with Tanzania’s Ministry of Health and Ministry of Local Government, supported by a five-year memorandum of understanding (MOU) and a collaborative design and test phase for the platform.

The target beneficiaries are primarily citizens, with an emphasis on women and lower socio-economic populations disproportionately affected by the healthcare system's inadequacies. The proposal outlines operational details, including strategies for both direct and indirect feedback pathways, intended to improve health system responsiveness and accountability.

The team is composed of professionals with diverse backgrounds, including healthcare, technology, and social enterprise, ensuring a comprehensive approach to the project's challenges. Afya Pamoja's funding model is grant-based, with a strategy to secure financial sustainability through government cost-sharing arrangements, bi-/multilateral development partner commitments, and global health donors.

Impact goals stretch over the next five years, aiming for national scale to cover all 10,000 healthcare facilities in Tanzania. The proposal underscores a commitment to improving healthcare quality and outcomes, supported by rigorous monitoring, evaluation, and a forthcoming randomized control trial (RCT) to further validate the platform's efficacy.

In summary, the proposed solution addresses critical health service delivery challenges in Tanzania by leveraging mobile technology for scalable, real-time citizen feedback, aimed at making health systems more responsive and accountable to the populations they serve."

<p>Multiple factors contribute to low cure rates, adherence, defined as the <strong>extent to which families follow medical indications and treatments</strong> has been identified as <strong>an important factor to treatment success or failure.</strong> <strong>Poor adherence to oral chemotherapy has been established as one of the most important predictors of relapse and subsequent treatment failure and death.</strong> Whereas intravenous medication is administered at treatment centers, oral medications rely on caregivers and <strong>can't be directly measured by the care team.</strong> Monitoring oral adherence is important for teams in order to tailor clinical and educational interventions to fit patients needs and optimize treatments and save lives.</p>
<p>Our team does not have a way to monitor oral adherence other than directly asking the family. Verbal family reports can be inaccurate and sometimes willingly omit gaps in medication adherence due to caregiver error. Available technologies such as electronic pill counters can be expensive for cancer centers located in LMICs and don't provide an accurate measure as directly seeing the patient taking the medication would. These technologies also can't avoid caregiver forgetfulness to timely provide the medication. Other barriers include decreased motivation among patients to take bitter medications that cause unwanted side-effects. </p>
<p>Thus, socially accepted and cost-effective technology that allows teams to witness patients taking oral medications at home and increase motivation among patients is needed to save lives through optimizing oral therapies.</p>","<p>Our solution is a mobile application aimed at children and adolescents with cancer. The FAVapp includes functions that tackle multiple dimensions of adherence. </p>

<p>The game has three different play modes: Basic, where patients just record themselves taking their medication; Challenge, patients select a challenge (i,e. sing while you take your medication) and Creative, where they can send a video doing whatever they like and think is fun. </p>
<figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/60019_Captura%20de%20pantalla%202023-05-08%20a%20la%28s%29%2015_1440x810.png"" alt=""60019_Captura%20de%20pantalla%202023-05-08%20a%20la%28s%29%2015_1440x810.png"" /></figure><p>In order to maximize the number of videos received we created a token economy system where per each video, patients receive a number of points that can later be interchanged for prizes. This is a token economy system that will allow the team to assess oral adherence to life-saving chemotherapy and increase motivation among patients. </p>
<p>Patients can also win badges after completion of numbers of chemotherapy cycles without forgetting to take the medication. In the example below, this patient has won 29 points for taking their medication and a ""Adherence ambassador"" badge for completing a full treatment phase without failing to take their pills. </p>
<p>The videos can be publicly shared with other users (Users are authorized by the app administrators and can only be part if they are patients, caregivers or team members). Peers, parents and team members can like these videos and earn additional points, this way social reinforcement is included.</p>

<p><br /></p>","<p>El Salvador's National Childhood Program is supported by Fundación Ayúdame a Vivir. The program has national coverage of pediatric cancer and receives around <strong>258 new childhood cancer cases annually and treats 350 patients per year in an age range of 0-&lt;18 years.</strong> </p>
<p>According to socioeconomic interviews, 51% of our pediatric cancer population lives in extreme poverty and 49% of our patients live within a subsistence economy.  75% of children with cancer in El Salvador have to travel between 2-12 hours to reach the hospital, and only 25 % of the patients live in the surrounding cities near the hospital. </p>
<p>Abandonment of treatment rates in low and middle-income countries is high due to poverty, lack of access to treatment, and socioeconomic factors, but in El Salvador the abandonment of treatment rate is less than 1%, primarily fostered by education to the caregiver and a tracking protocol that allows healthcare personnel to detect absences in real-time. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents in El Salvador are a historically neglected population. Funding for our program relies on charitable support because the government allocation of resources for pediatric cancer only covers a small part of expenses in medication, food, supplies, physical spaces and staff salaries. <br /></p>
<p>This application will have a meaningful impact on survival. By reminding families to take the medication we mitigate the human error factor. Increased adherence to oral medication will allow oral drugs to exert their máximum therapeutical properties. With optimal doses of medications remissions are more likely to occur and children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer can have better chances to have a long and meaningful life. </p>
<p>The game and the token economy system will also increase motivation which will promote adaptation to treatment and help build resilience towards unwanted side-effects. We aim at making treatment for children and adolescents less painful and more rewarding in the short-term. </p>","<p>Our team has population-level access to children and adolescents with cancer. Because our program has national coverage and provides care along the cancer continuum, we work with our patients since diagnosis to survivorship or death. We have built strong relationships with patients and family members, some of those span decades. </p>
<p>The clinical and administrative staff work close with families. For instance, the same team of psychologists, physicians and nurses provide care since day one and keep working with families even years after a child's recovery or death. Thus, every staff member, care provider, patient and supporter is part of a community with the same objective. <br /></p>
<p>The psychology team is leading this project and is composed of three people, Carmen, Carolina, and Alvaro.  Our office is based at our center, which means we have daily contact with patients and their families. </p>
<p>We have reach further than the family that comes to the center to the local community where patients live. Through support from neighbors, city halls, local hospitals and clinics, schools and extended family, we make sure every child and adolescent with cancer has the care they need and deserve. Families trust out team and believe in our endeavor of saving lives, for example, in 2018 Gabriel, one of our patients accepted the opportunity to ask global leaders at the UN assembly to increase funding and support for children with cancer as a sign of trust in our team and allies. <br /></p>
<p>To understand the needs or our patients, their families and communities we do qualitative research to get in-deep insights of their agendas and visions. For the conceptualization of this project, a qualitative research consisting of semi-structured questions was performed to understand their perception of oral medication and the barriers they face to comply with prescriptions. A focus group with care providers was developed to verify if this technology would be socially acceptable. We can state that families and patients are willing to send their videos and believe that having a reward system based on prizes and social reinforcements will be welcome. </p>","Enable continuity of care, particularly around primary health, complex or chronic diseases, and mental health and well-being.",San Salvador,El Salvador,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone","<p><strong>Right now the app is already developed.

<p>We have already passed the concept stage of exploring the idea and have verified that FAVapp is a socially acceptable idea, can be sustainable and have a positive effect on survival. As expressed above, for this stage we developed a research consisting in individual interviews and a focus group. </p>
<p><br /></p>",<p>At this time no patients are using FAVapp for being in a prototype stage. </p>,"<p>Financial barriers: Fundación Ayúdame a Vivir is a non-profit organization and relies on funding from donors. In order to have an mobile application running, we need to find opportunities to pitch to investors and/or funders to pay for subscriptions, storage and additional support staff. </p>
<p>Onboarding: New technologies can be socially accepted but still need to be adopted by communities. SOLVE can help us connect with experts who will help FAVapp to be seen by families and team members as a key resource to save lives. Thus, this will increase usage. </p>
<p>Technical: Eventually the FAVapp will need to increase its capabilities. We expect to use AI to identify the medication name on the wrapping show by the patient and then automatize the scoring process. When the user number increases an automated process to move appointment, medication and patient data will have to take place. Thus, the application storage will also need to be increased and new technologies involved. Technical consulting will be a needed to grow according to the market standards. </p>
<p>Growing: To be able to have an organized growth, we need solutions to increase our team capabilities and management. This is important so we can jump to scaling where other pediatric cancer programs can be involved. </p>
<p>Scaling: We believe that FAVapp is a solution that can be used in pediatric cancer programs around the world. Because we have found a way to visually verify that our patients take their medication other teams can also monitor their patient's progress. Around the world, most pediatric cancer programs include oral medication in their treatment protocols. Thus, we need support to pitch and market this idea to other program leaders and develop tailored versions for their specific needs. Most important our teams needs consulting in how to prepare our organization to lead this effort. </p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact), Product / Service Distribution (e.g. delivery, logistics, expanding client base), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)","No, Solve is the first network joined",,Email from your network,<p>We have applied for MIT's SOLVE and HORIZON challenges since 2020. </p>,"<p>The most common approach to measure medication adherence is clinical proxy report. This is, families reporting to care team their medication taking habits. Other technologies involve electronic pill counters to measure drug consumption. The problem with this approach is that caregivers are unable to actually see the patient taking the right medication at the right time during a timeframe. Therefore inaccuracies can occur out forgetfulness and even dishonesty. This approach also prevents care teams to monitor adherence in real-time. </p>
<p>Our solution offers an innovative approach that allows our team to actually see our patients complying with medical indications at home. The rules of the game clearly establish that the wrapping need to be readable and the pill need to be taken clearly from it. We understand that some people may interpret this approach as invasive and distrustful from the team. This is why the game and a token economy system makes sending a video more friendly and goal-oriented. </p>
<p>Our app is not only a game, most similar applications only record user or care provider generated data. FAVapp integrates everything in a single environment that can be accessible to caregivers and patients.</p>

Our fundraising team is well-trained in the field of fundraising for pediatric oncology.</p>
<p>Funding for the national cancer program comes from the government, through the Ministry of Health, and fundraising by Fundación Ayúdame a Vivir. From this funding comes all chemotherapy, antibiotics, staff salaries and supplies. Patients from all over the country are referred by primary and secondary level hospitals and once a cancer diagnosis has been established, they are immediately admitted to the program. Patients might have out-of-pocket expenses, like travel expenses, and this is also sometimes covered by FAV and its allies. <br /></p>
<p>One of the major sources of revenue is the donor program which has existed for 30 years. In 2021 Movimiento Amarillo replaced the existing donor program and it came with benefits for our donors. Recently, our fundraising team has launched a discount card for monthly donors starting at $10/month.

With this funding we will be able to operate for at least a year. Part of the funds we are seeking will be dedicated to increase warehouse existence of prizes. <br /></p><p>During the second phase we plan to sell subscriptions to other pediatric cancer programs in the region. Because this application needs to be managed by members of the care team, institutional databases and access will be created to ensure confidentiality for each pediatric cancer program. We plan to charge a initial membership fee as well as a monthly rate for maintenance depending on the number of users on each program. Fees can be determined based on financial capability studies for each program so FAVapp becomes an affordable tool that can provide value and supports our operation and institutional missions.</p><p>Central American countries all have a national pediatric cancer program that survives through their non-profit organizations.

Some examples include funding from Fundacion Gloria Kriete, which provided funds for a Flow Cytometry Laboratory valued at approximately $100,000, which provides a timely diagnosis of pediatric patients with leukemia. The leukemia immunophenotype determination allows the treatment assignment based on the risk stratification of the disease. Before acquiring the Flow Cytometry, diagnoses were made in Guatemala and took up to 3 days. Today we can make a leukemia diagnosis in 24 hours.  </p>
<p>In 2013, grants totaling more than $636,000 over two years were awarded to two physicians.

The solution addresses the critical problem of low cure rates in Low-and-Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to inadequate access to scientific, technological, and therapeutic advances in pediatric oncology. Specifically, the app targets the issue of oral medication adherence, which is a significant predictor of treatment success. The app is in the prototype development stage, with a version 1.0 ready for initial user interface and user experience testing.

FAVapp incorporates a game-like interface where patients can record and share videos of themselves taking their medication, thereby allowing healthcare teams to visually confirm adherence. The application features a token economy system, where patients earn points that can be exchanged for prizes, to motivate adherence. Additionally, the app includes functionalities for tracking medication schedules, reporting side effects, and managing medical appointments, with the provision for real-time alerts and notifications.

The solution specifically serves El Salvador's National Childhood Cancer Program, supported by Fundación Ayúdame a Vivir, which annually treats approximately 350 pediatric cancer cases. The application aims to improve cure rates by increasing medication adherence through direct monitoring and motivational incentives. A secondary goal is to collect data that can inform policy and protocol development. The team behind FAVapp is closely linked with the target population, enabling direct feedback and adaptation of the app based on user needs.

FAVapp's innovative approach lies in its real-time video verification of medication intake, integrated care functionalities, and a reward system designed to improve adherence. The application's success will be measured by the number of downloads, user engagement levels, and ultimately, an increase in the net survival rate of pediatric cancer patients in El Salvador. The proposal outlines a plan for financial sustainability, initially relying on donations and grants, with a long-term strategy of offering subscription-based access to other pediatric cancer programs. The solution's progress toward impact goals will be evaluated through various metrics, including changes in yearly net survival rates and the number of new users both within El Salvador and in pediatric cancer programs adopting the app globally."

76326,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,AI enabled posture correction sensor device to prevent long term complications of spine related disorders,"<p>In today's world of advancements, nearly 84% of people face neck and back pain at some point in their lives, of which 90% is attributed to bad posture. This leads to cervical and lumbar spondylosis, kyphoscoliosis and paraspinal muscle spasm. Poor posture can lead to more pain along with the degradation of the tissues surrounding our joints. </p>
<p>There is wide spread acceptance now that spine related disorders are caused by sedentary life style and prolonged use of systems or gadgets[1,2]. This became more evident during COVID period when people were subjected to work from home, students gluing to mobile phones and TV or computer system for long durations leading to neck and back discomfort and some landing up in reversible or irreversible spinal diseases.  Sushilowati et al in one of the studies reported Complaints of musculoskeletal origins were recounted by 70.5% of the total respondents, with a majority of the reports said to affect the neck (86.4%), lower back (75.9%), and right and left shoulders (76.2%) in a questionnaire based studies on a population based sample size of 51,472 people [3]. Complaints about the neck were the most discomfort reported by the said community while operating electronic gadgets, as a consequence of the neck posture assumed while staring at screens or monitors during the use of these devices.  Despite widespread acceptance that work related spinal disorders and back pain can be prevented by fixing the posture through ergonomic solutions such as adjustable chairs or other modifications applied to the workstation, there exists very few reliable and accurate methods of continuously monitoring posture in any environment for postural modification. Recently, wearable sensing technologies targeting posture monitoring have been attracting increasing attention, making postural monitoring not restricted to a single location, thus enabling real time measurements and monitoring of posture[4].</p>
<p>Different solutions for monitoring postural activity are reported in the literature, researchers working on such technologies are attempting to integrate wearable computing devices and sensors into textiles for data collection[5] . However, due to the novelty of this field and unavailability of datasets and information on sensor development done by previous researches, most effort is still directed towards development of the measuring method and accuracy. Thus, the integration of the sensors into a complete system as well as aspects like comfort, aesthetics and wearability are undergoing a process of evolution [5,6,7,8].There has been multiple previous work done for the same we have tried out[9-11].</p>
<p>The major cause of health issues secondary to prolonged use of smart phones and gadgets are because of neck position due to prolonged declination. Kennith H reported in one of the studies while the standard weight applied on the spinal cord is normally 10 - 12 lbs. , when the Cervical Spine is colinear with the spinal cord it rises steeply to 60 lbs. , when the user’s neck is declined at 60 degrees from the body’s longitudinal axis [12]. Author used Accelerometer device to ascertain the bend in neck and resulting changes in the pressure [13] .</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>Ergon is an ai enabled smart wearable device , which primarily functions to alert a user whenever their posture is incorrect , and create a habit for everyone to maintain proper spinal health. </p>
<p>This solution has gone through many iterations , spanning over 3 years and 4 versions. </p>
<p>The latest version is equipped with a flex sensor, which is attached to the user's cervical and thoracic spinal region through a comfortable belt. A flex sensor is a variable resistor , which has a conducting ink inside it which spreads , when the sensor is bent, thereby changing the resistance offered and thus the voltage output.</p>
<p>This is used to classify different bending angles and thus different postures accurately (i.e normal and abnormal posture).Once the user wears the device ,they callibrate the device and set a referrence reading about which the deviation in reading is analyzed to classify posture readings.</p>
<p>The belt contains a vibrator module which buzzes and alerts the user through haptic vibrations, to correct their posture and thus helps in habit creation for people of all ages.</p>
<p> Using a bluetooth module , all this data can be sent to the application where one can track their postural status on the go in real time. The app also converts the collected data in forms of graphs and charts , which are directly sent to the user's doctors like neurologists , orthopadeciands and physiotherapists , which can allow early diagnosis of sponylosis , kyphoscoliosis , paraspinal muscle spasm etc. </p>
<p>Currently the product is being redesigned with the use of an accelerometer , making the system more compact and user friendly , also giving room for more accurate data collection at an affordable price. Primary diagnosis can also be made by the application using an AI based classifier which can classify the symptoms of the user from the collected data to alert the user whether they need medical attention or not. </p>","<p>A large number of the working population have office jobs that require long hours of sitting, and students spend most of their time on laptops devices leaning forward and these habits lay significant strain on the neck and back. We wanted to access the magnitude of problem and health issues arising from forced work standards and remedies there upon.
</p>
<p>The device that we have formulated was based on the idea to reduce chronic pain that results from poor posture which ultimately will help to reduce the stress and pressure on the spine and prevent musculoskeletal disorders and structural deformity of spine.

<p><br /></p>","<p><strong>Wearable system</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Design Thinking , Testing And Training</strong></p>
<p>I went through several stages of testing and improvisation and the main changes made were mainly in the sensors and the wearable device’s design. While conducting surveys, many participants said that the innerwear solution was a solution that could easily be integrated into their day to day lives, but many complaints came with respect to washing , reusing it every day etc. Then we came up with a new design , using a cotton sleeve, but  it led to a couple of problems like discomfort , rashes and allergies. So I came up with use of buckles and straps which were thin and comfortable to wear, with which the user can wear the cotton sleeve on their backs. The use of these sleeves would make it easier to remove the sensor module and wash the sleeve at the end of every day and then wear it the next day again.</p>
<p>Ergon began with a careful study of sensors and their integration into a compact design which will be easy to wear, user friendly and comfortable. To detect the variation in posture, we first used infrared sensors . Infrared sensors or IR sensors basically detect the heat radiation (infrared radiation) that changes over time and space due to the movement of people.</p>
<p>This mechanism however gave false positive readings even if the back was in a proper posture (since the natural spinal arch would be detected as an abnormality). IR sensors also gave inaccurate readings in the presence of sunlight and their placement would make the overall device very large and thus would not be comfortable to wear by a user.</p>
<p>We had to thus explore more options, which was when we came across the ‘Flex Sensor’. A Flex Sensor is basically a variable potentiometer , which on bending gives different resistances and thus different voltage drop. This mechanism was far more accurate compared to the initial one since it was now easy to set a particular range of bending angles which would indicate a correct posture , and thus would give more accurate readings. This would also be compact and thus easy to integrate into a smaller system, making it user friendly and thus a more usable version.
</p>
<p>To construct our circuit we needed certain key components which include a microcontroller (Arduino Nano), a Vibrator module(Flat 1034 Mobile Phone Vibrator Motor),  a Bluetooth module (Bluetooth HC-05) and a flex sensor. All the components are compact and thus they were easy to integrate into a small circuit.</p>
<p>The data collected was transferred through the Bluetooth module to our application , which would then display the postural status of the user in real time , organisation and tabulation of this data over a time of 1 week would allow us to display weekly posture progress reports, and the app also contains free training links and videos to stay fit and healthy.</p>","Enable continuity of care, particularly around primary health, complex or chronic diseases, and mental health and well-being.","Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India",India,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone","<p>CURRENT PROTOTYPE USED

<p>Many teenagers have stunted growth and hunchbacks due to bad posture , which comes with severe pain , humiliation and in several cases , restrictions from doing day to day activities that one should be able to do. </p>
<p>Ergon thus impacts the society by providing a one stop solution to bad posture, by introducing a solution which creates a habit and allow early diagnosis and cure of chronic spinal disorders. </p>
<p>Ergon also is an affordable solution which gives accurate data collection and alerts than anyother device available in the market in today's day. </p>","<p>The core technology powering ergon is the flex sensor , embedded systems , application tie up and the use of AI classification . Ergon tracks a user's postural status using the sensor collected data , which is then sent to the app through a bluetooth module . An AI classifier can do the primary diagnosis to see if there is any symptoms of chonic spinal disorders , and organises the data collected in form of graphs charts etc which can be sent to a doctor directly. This will thus allow early diagnosis and prevention of spinal disorders. Using a vibrator module , ergon alerts any user if their postural status is abnormal using haptic vibrations , thus making it easy for any user to create a habit to maintain a healthy spine. </p>
<p>The application necessarily links the entire circuit by being a mode in which one can view their postural health status in real time , making it a tool for people to monitor their postural health like an ecg , but on the go.

76409,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,Destroying seeds in sexuality is the sole cause of all disease and poverty in the world. The divine law “SEED ONLY MAKES THE FRUIT” is equally applicable to humans as well. Our solution is to educate humans all over the world to follow SAVE-SEED so that they can get good health and wealth naturally.,"<p>Holistically, Educationists, Scientists,
Spiritual Gurus, Celebrities, Capitalists and Politicians guide, govern and
control the world. Many scholars and organizations, like MIT Solve, are working
hard for the well-being of the people from their own point of view. But despite
the tireless efforts of all, the life of common people is becoming increasingly
difficult. It is clear from this that all of us, knowingly or unknowingly, are
making some big mistake, towards which no one is paying attention.</p>
<p>That big mistake
is that most human beings are destroying their seeds in transient pleasure
(sexuality) which definitely brings disease and poverty in life. It is a divine
law that SEED ONLY MAKES THE FRUIT. Human beings are also no exception in the
context of this divine law. It is a great irony that no one knows how our seeds
are working subconsciously in our body to make their fruits of success. Most of
the human beings are not getting the fruits of success (health and wealth)
because of destroying their seeds.</p>
<p>The cause
of all the problems of the world is disease and poverty. Because of increasing
problems of disease and poverty many other problems are also increasing day by
day for humanity and nature. Global warming, natural calamities, depletion of
natural resources, terrorism, wars, crimes, inflation, inequality etc. are the
few outcomes of increasing problems of disease and poverty.</p>
<p>Today the
world is in a very alarming situation. To save the world, we have to
understand, follow and spread the natural science of health and wealth,
SAVE-SEED. Just as the world was fighting as a whole during the 2020 pandemic,
similarly we have to holistically act upon to spread SAVE-SEED awareness for
the well-being of the people around the world.</p>
<p>Today, in
order to make human beings around the world healthy and wealthy naturally, they
need to be educated about SAVE-SEED. <b>SAVE-SEED
means  maintaining complete purity in mind, body and deeds while having a
relationship only with the spouse for life.</b> By following SAVE-SEED lifelong, one gets good health, wealth, name
and fame naturally.</p>
<p>Now time
has come for all human beings to seriously understand the importance of the
only law of nature, SAVE-SEED. We humans get health and wealth in life
naturally through our seeds. To understand this natural process in detail on a
scientific basis, you must watch my promo video “Natural Science of Health and
Wealth: Save-Seed (<a href=""https://youtu.be/os8IUtt8BfE"">https://youtu.be/os8IUtt8BfE</a>) and detailed video presentation
“Divine Dharma Save-Seed” (<a href=""https://youtu.be/OOpzHKfV5uM"">https://youtu.be/OOpzHKfV5uM</a>). For more videos and ebook, you
can visit the website <a href=""http://www.anarvam.com/"">www.anarvam.com</a>.</p>","<p>You will be pleasantly surprised to know that nature has evolved
human beings in such a way that whatever we dream in our mind, it automatically
comes true. Still, the dreams of most human beings do not come true, because of
a world-wide misconception, humans have understood their brain as their mind.
Neuroscientists and scholars have not yet been able to properly understand the
wireless processing of seed DNA in the brain. In fact, our mind is in our seeds
(mRNA). The dream of our mind is the fruit of our seed. Our seeds work
subconsciously to make our mind’s dreams come true. Just as the whole tree is
hidden in a seed, similarly the whole creature and human is hidden in a seed.
That is, our subconscious mind and conscious mind both are in our seeds. Our
brain wirelessly processes the genetic codes of the seed’s DNA and gives us the
fruits of success by attracting energy resources from the universe. Modern
science discoveries like <b>Cosmic
Ray Air Showers </b>proved that there
are lots of energy particles forming in the atmosphere. DNA of human seed acts
like a SIM card to interact with these free energy particles to fulfill all our
desires. </p>
<p>The dream
we see through the mind of our seed, that dream becomes the fruit of our seeds.
<b>IT IS A DIVINE LAW THAT THE SEED
ONLY MAKES THE FRUIT. </b>All plants,
creatures and human beings in nature work on the same principle of getting
fruit from seed. A seed first makes the tree, and then many seeds on that tree
make many fruits. A human is also born from a seed, therefore the same process
works for humans as well. A seed first makes our body, and then many seeds in
the body give the fruits of many successes. The seed creates the brain in the
body for the success of the dreams of its mind. Our brain processes the genetic
code of our seed DNA through the wireless nerve system and brings us the
success we want.</p>
<p>There are
three types of life in the world, flora, fauna and humans. Flora’s Read-Only
DNA attracts energy resources through fixed contacts (roots). Fauna’s
Write-Once DNA attracts energy resources through movable contacts (organs).
Human’s Read-Write DNA attracts energy resources through wireless contacts
(plexus). Information embedded in the seed’s DNA is processed wirelessly in the
brain. To understand this process in detail, you must watch my promo video

The core premise is based on the assertion that ""destroying seeds in sexuality"" significantly contributes to the proliferation of disease and poverty globally. The proposal posits that following the SAVE-SEED principle, which involves maintaining purity in thoughts and actions and engaging in sexual activity solely with one's spouse for life, can naturally lead to improved health, wealth, name, and fame.

The solution criticizes the current guidance and governance systems worldwide, suggesting that despite significant efforts from various sectors, common people's lives are becoming increasingly challenging. It attributes a significant part of societal issues—ranging from natural calamities and global warming to wars and inequality—to the degradation and mismanagement of human reproductive material, framed as 'seeds' throughout the document.

The proposal claims that its approach is grounded in both scientific and spiritual beliefs, although it appears to primarily lean on a novel interpretation of spiritual laws and natural processes. It makes connections between the human seed—specifically, its DNA—and the brain's purported ability to wirelessly process genetic codes to attract energy resources from the universe, thereby fulfilling personal desires and dreams.

The target audience for this educational initiative is the global population, with an assertion that particularly half of the global population living in poverty can benefit from it. The initiative is currently positioned in the 'Growth' stage, signifying that it has moved beyond the conceptual phase and has been introduced in some communities. However, specific evidence supporting the efficacy of this methodology or its broader acceptance and implementation details remain unspecified.

76609,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Selected,Evidence based digital trauma therapy platform using neuroscience to advance mental healthcare accessibility for marginalized communities.,"<p>70% of the global population has been exposed to a trauma at least once in their life and 13% of these individuals may develop PTSD (Steel et al., 2009). The global refugee population stood at 26.4 million individuals according to the UNHCR at the end of 2020.76% of Canadians reported experiencing a traumatic event at least once in a lifetime (Ameringen, Mancini &amp; Boyle, 2008) The prevalence of PTSD in Canada remains high at 9.2% (Ameringen et al., 2008), and higher for minority groups, such as Black and Arab Canadians (~10%) (Statistics Canada, 2022). Among those that screen positive for PTSD, these individuals are 2-7 times more likely to report anxiety, depression, suicide ideation and increased drug use symptoms (Government of Canada, 2021). With the recent SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, this number is only expected to rise (Statistics Canada, 2020). Almost 25% of Canadians who met the criteria for PTSD reported their most recent traumatic event occurred during the pandemic (Government of Canada, 2021).</p>
<p>Despite the high prevalence of PTSD in Canada and globally, accessing mental health care to treat trauma and PTSD is a challenge. 82% of those screened positive for PTSD were unable to receive the help they needed due to long wait times (39%), appointment rescheduling (38%) and financial costs (37%) (Statistics Canada, 2022). WHO's Mental Health Atlas 2017, a global assessment of mental health resources and services, it is estimated that less than 10% of people with mental disorders, including PTSD, in low-income countries receive treatment from specialized mental health facilities.</p>
<p>For minority groups in Canada, these barriers may be exacerbated alongside additional barriers they face, such as structural accessibility factors due to living in a new environment and culture. For instance, language barriers and the lack of professional interpreters (Colucci et al., 2015; Subedi et al., 2015) are significant obstacles, as it hinders communication with professionals and further discourages seeking support (Tribe, 2002)</p>
<p>Savyn solves the problem of accessibility by digitizing existing evidence-based PTSD neuropsychiatry treatments on our website, providing access to trauma survivors who fail to get help due to resource shortage of therapists, higher costs and geographic barriers as most healthcare is concentrated in urban centers. We meet UN SDG Goals 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing) and Goal 10 (reducing inequities) by democratizing access to trauma therapies.</p>","<p>Savyn is a proprietary website that is accessed by trauma survivors (patients) with on-call supervision available to assist if needed, using trauma-informed care approach. Our solution assesses the patient's symptoms, records their history and prepares them with grounding tools to be used throughout their subsequent sessions. They come into our application for 8 weeks for 45 minute weekly sessions, where they will do a series of neuroscience based exercises that promotes rewiring of the neurocircuitry to attach less distress to their traumatic incident. Savyn works on both the patient's memory and physiological responses to the trauma, thereby healing holistically. Our current clinical study’s initial data at Sick Kids Research Institute in Toronto shows we improve the patients' PTSD distress symptoms by 65% by the eighth session. There is no coaching or homework requirements from the patient, therefore putting less burden on them to do the work.</p>
<p>We are using full-stack cloud based technology to transform an in-person clinical intervention into a virtual end-to-end digital therapeutics that can be used without human intervention. The application integrates techniques that emphasize trauma-informed care by prioritizing the emotional, psychological and physical safety of the client throughout the treatment</p>
<p>The integration of these techniques in Savyn’s holistic digital therapeutic application ensures the safety of the client in all aspects throughout the treatment process. Our platform can become a game changer in providing effective PTSD intervention and treatment strategies in low income communities and those with geographically limited resources</p>","<p>With 85% of diagnosed PTSD patients not getting access to mental health care (Stats Can) and less than 10% of global communities getting access to mental health care (WHO) and growing refugee crisis due to ongoing conflict and climate change, we address the urgent need to have care that is easily accessed at an affordable rate, positively impacting the lives of people with trauma and PTSD. Our goals align with reducing inequalities and good health and well being of people . With this in mind, the  target audience of the project Includes all equity-seeking groups since these groups are more likely to disproportionately have PTSD due to intersectionality, but also may not receive appropriate and effective means to heal from their trauma due to financial and cultural barriers. Equity-seeking groups including racialized people, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, indigenous communities, and veterans  are more likely to benefit from a digitized therapeutic platform where they can easily access different tools for healing their trauma. </p>
<p>Since our solution is a website, there is no travel required to get access to treatment, with the added benefit of reducing the carbon emissions and our carbon footprint of our solution. Many people in remote areas and indigenous communities can access these therapies from the comfort of their homes. </p>
<p>We will be able to contribute to meaningful changes in the patient’s lives, the communities they live in and reduce the overall mental health cost to the system due to lost productivity by reducing their PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms often involve impacts to well-being and quality of life, increased addictions and suicide ideation which our solution can help manage.</p>

Savyn platform requires the user to do about eight sessions (once per week, each 45 minutes) identifying their emotions, where they feel them in their physical bodies and rewire the brain using different modalities of eye movements. Savyn's therapy has less burden on the patient as they are not required to do homework or process through talking about their distress too much. This is an adapted therapy based on existing evidence based therapy of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). This is unique as many therapies require users to write down, think through or process their trauma, which can be triggering and lead to the abandonment of treatment. Our initial clinical data shows our treatment can be three times faster than traditional therapies. Our solution has been developed by in-house research with review and feedback from expert trauma therapists in Canada. </p>
<p>Our current clinical study’s initial data have shown positive outcomes for patients that are on par with in-person therapy. With our platform we can scale services at clinics for more patient throughputs, reduce waiting times for patients and remove barriers to accessing mental health care by providing affordable and faster care. We will be able to contribute to the reduction of the current annual Canadian mental health cost, estimated at 50 billion dollars according to CAMH.

Despite challenges in scaling and securing additional funding for commercialization, the team has already secured CAD $160,900 from various sources and is actively working towards financial sustainability through a mix of grants, investment, and revenue from B2B partnerships."
76649,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,A new model that protects employment by addressing aging care delivery in the nation by reducing the re-deployment of employed family members to be healthcare assistants at home.,"<p>Caregiving Contaminates National Employment</p>
<p>As our population ages and the workforce becomes more demanding, the collision between family caregiving and work is a source of significant stress. This problem is left for families to solve.
  </p>
<p>Globally, societies need an updated caregiving model. As a country, we see a family problem and a healthcare issue. Younger, healthy, working family members expect to step up and care for older relatives. The healthcare system should provide medical care, and we expect it covers everything, but it doesn’t.
  </p>
<p>Employers face an employment crisis as most (55% to 70%) of every workforce are caring for aging family. The shifts now impact a critical mass of society, disproportionately affecting women and minorities.
  </p>
<p>Traditionally, a family member (usually a woman) managed household responsibilities, including care for children, aging relatives, and family members with a disability. In the latter half of the 20th century, women began to move out of the home and into the workforce. This created the beginnings of the caregiving evolution.
  </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9ZQ3yALPhU&amp;ab_channel=CareWiseSolutions"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9ZQ3yALPhU&amp;ab_channel=CareWiseSolutions</a> 
  </p>
<p>Healthcare has not kept pace with mounting demands from aging baby boomers, dependent adults, and veterans with long-term disabilities.
  </p>
<p>Business leaders are uninformed. 
  </p>
<p>Family structures fracture.
  </p>
<p>Those needing care are isolated with inadequate services. 
  </p>
<p>Employers and employees experience massive losses.
  </p>
<p>The 7.2m unfilled homecare jobs exacerbate the reliance on families to provide healthcare assistance. Every workforce is redeployed to fill care jobs. Employers lose economic and human resources. 
  </p>
<p>Traditional leaders maintaining embedded ideologies drive current national care efforts, mostly caregiving-centric non-profits, private insurance providers, family care foundations, and corporate benefits professionals.
  </p>
<p>Overburdened caregivers cannot work. Employees find their health, job, careers, and family commitments impacted beyond the breaking point. Employers only retain a sustainable workforce with a changed care system.
  </p>
<p>Without professional home care staff, employees rely on leaves of absence and time off instead of positively contributing to the organization’s success and building a career balanced with a beneficial role supporting family. 
  </p>
<p>The care gap between initial family care responsibilities and when loved ones become a full-time patient is currently underfunded and lacks infrastructure, with a desparate impact on BIPOC and women. This care gap drives employees out of the workforce long-term, without reemployment prospects. 
  </p>
<p>A model is needed to address:
  </p>
<ul><li>Shared vision and values for the way we      work, live and care.
  </li><li>Visible cross-industry commitment to transformation.
  </li><li>Acceleration of labor alignment, workforce      stability, staffing care-at-home jobs.
  </li><li>Transition Plans installing Centers of      Excellence and job creation for skilled care employees.
  </li><li>Beta testing CareWise Solutions partnering      with diverse innovators of family care products, services, and technology.      
  </li><li>Workforce development efforts preparing care      professionals to relieve employed family from home healthcare.
  </li><li>Communications, education, and solutions,      especially through employers, to reduce overwhelming burdens of informal      caregivers.
  </li><li>Coordinated information and data management.      
 </li></ul><p>Today, 69 million people are informal caregivers, 70 million more baby boomers are aging, and 7.2 million open jobs in skilled care in the home are unfilled.

<p>A paradigm shift is required to fundamentally change the caregiver culture. Preserving Employment is a national risk.

As an enterprise program, leaders initiate and create performance expectations for integrating care into mainstream business operations.
  </p>
<p>Caregiving Workforce Transitions directly support employed caregivers at any level of the organization on their caregiving journey. For stressed, overwhelmed, and overworked caregivers tired of being told to meditate and take time off work. 
  </p>
<p>The Caring Place HUB online dashboard includes access to proprietary and curated resources for Employee-Caregivers and their families. The resources help keep employees on the job and build confidence that care support is adequately performed at home.
  </p>
<p>Access to staffing, skilled care facilities, government agencies and professional sites, home care resources, and custom products, such as safety sensors, prescription discounts and more, are available in the curated marketplace.
  </p>
<p>A self-paced Employee Orientation is for everyone at all levels of the organization. The orientation helps clarify the workforce issues, as half of the team has family caregiving responsibilities. Participants examine how the care crisis impacts their organization, colleagues, and themselves.

  </p>
","<p>The caregiving crisis is based on a lack of clarity and definition of roles in the healthcare-to-home system. The shortage of skilled workers and high turnover in professional roles to support fragile health is tied to job design and career opportunities, leading to a lack of respect and dignity. This results in a lower quality of life for aging and people with disabilities in the home and in skilled nursing facilities.</p>
<p>Physicians and healthcare retail delivery systems (CVS and Walmart) are handing over nursing responsibilities to family members without delegation of care. The family caregivers do not have the skills to perform quality care and no method to measure patient outcomes. The assumption is that there is a capable and available family caregiver to support fragile health in every home. 
  </p>
<p>Our solution draws the boundaries between services provided by the healthcare system and what must be performed at home. For family boundaries to be respected, healthcare must build organization capacity.  
  </p>
<p>Our system services employers to boldly push back unacceptable assumptions that employees be forced into a (family nursing) career that was not in their plan. We also equip employers with the tools to understand and respond to unfair expectations that impact employee health, income, family structures, community position, and career. 
  </p>
<p>Our system supports the development of the 7.2 million required workers and job creation to reduce the instance of fragile health in the community. Employee caregivers are experiencing extreme mental health and stress related disabilities as they try to fit two jobs into 24 hours in a day without a support system, skills or resources.

<p>Caregiving Workforce Transitions will allow employers overseeing those with family caregiving responsibilities and their ability to manage the burdens being placed on them resulting in issues such as –
  </p>
<p><b>Stress and Burnout</b> – Caregivers’ physical and mental health worsens over an average of 5 ½ years of caring for a loved one. Being on-call all the time for those with chronic conditions causes the most emotional stress. Guilt about not providing adequate care to loved ones.                                       
  </p>
<p><b>Reduced Productivity</b> - Something has to give when you feel torn between your career and providing the best care. Stress over what’s happening at home can make you sick, too.
  </p>
<p><b>Absenteeism</b> – As a family caregiver, some time off is inevitable, but everyone needs to minimize their time away.
  </p>
<p><b>Team Spillover</b> – About half of the team has caregiving responsibilities. Coping with these dual roles, the effects spill over onto the entire workforce. Resentment and isolation build as the rest pick up the slack for more stigma and more mental health issues. 
  </p>
<p><b>Time Management </b>– As a caregiver, you have less time for your career, yourself, and other family members. You sacrifice things you enjoy. Trouble balancing work with care responsibilities may mean missing opportunities.
  </p>
<p><b>Career Identity</b> – Many employees built a reputation and invested in career growth. Suddenly, caregiving changes their ability to live up to their expectations of themselves and that others have of them.

</p>","<p>Steeped in 25 years of transformational leadership in a global, Fortune 50 corporation, Jeannette offers alternative paths to the current economic, human capital and digital ecosystem employee caregiving models for work and care across America.
  </p>
<p>Jeannette introduces and builds on several themes that focus on improving the human caregiver experience and building “longevity-of-care” solutions. These achieve many outcomes, including support for the employee-caregiver job of choice retention and assistance for employers to build and sustain a viable workforce to reach its engagement and productivity goals. This is achieved as employee-caregivers are enabled by a seamless, national caregiver system with shared values, policies, labor, insurance, healthcare, community services, and public health operations… all operating in a coordinated, collaborative ecosystem of care.
  </p>
<p>Jeannette has been a thought leader and solutions provider during some of the most challenging times as the Bell System was experiencing a 10-year deregulation and reinvention era. She advanced to head of the organization and people strategies for AT&amp;T. As the senior executive for technical staff development, her work included consulting with Singapore to build a technical university. She led ten medical centers providing employee health and wellness services.
  </p>
<p>She was a regular spokesperson on organization transformation to the Wall Street Journal Fast Company magazine and Sunday morning business shows, recognized by thousands of media outlets. She is the author of The Global Caregiving Gold Rush and Stories for Leadership Insights.
  </p>
<p>Jeannette has been building a network of support. CareWise Solutions is introducing the CareWise model in insurance, skilled care, and healthcare institutions. We have input from employees and existing care workers in the home and those serving support roles to families in the home. We have been presenters at the Internet of Things (IoT) Revolution conference, presented and participated in Rutgers’s Business School Institute for Social Innovation, and taught over 1000 international students about the wellness, work and care challenges in their United Nations Sustainable Goal Development Effort. 
  </p>
<p>Jeannette is conducting CareWise Seminars and forming partnerships across private employers in all related industries. We have relationships and hold memberships with caregiving professional associations.  
  </p>
<p>Jeannette is also the mom of two daughters with developmental disabilities and shared aging care roles with her sisters. 
  </p>
<p>CareWise Solutions has convened a global team bringing innovative solutions in a new marketplace- a work-life and caring ecosystem. CareWise Solutions for employers and employee-caregivers is our specialty. We are involved with the entire care system. Our CareWise partners work hand-in-glove in skilled facilities, building operational solutions for the nursing team, residents, and families.
  </p>
<p>We are a modest entrepreneurial group living and working in the United States, South America, Ukraine, India, Egypt, Pakistan, Australia, the Philippines, and the UK. Most team members bring personal experience in the dual role of being a caregiver and earning a living. That definitely increases our sensitivity and makes our words much more than talk. We know that you need solutions!

<p>Structurally, there is understaffing, insufficient or poor methods of psych education, culturally appropriate training,systematic methods to screen at community or population level. Also, currently only episodic clinical data is collected without lived experience data to get insights to risk-stratify and perform proactive referrals into acute care and/or primary care. More daunting is prospect for hiring fast enough to keep up, even as current professionals are experiencing burnout and leaving. Prevention focus to reduce burden on understaffed acute care system is vital but lacking.</p>
<p>At the user level, patient centered approaches with design thinking and appropriate theory of change models to effect therapy-seeking or preventive self-care is lacking. Activating the withdrawn and lonely populations don't exist. Prevention focus knowing that general levels of acuity, substance abuse are better tackled earlier at first symptoms are understood but not implemented, especially for different sub-groups that need different approaches to activate change. </p>
<p>We deploy knowledge base with clinicians in the loop to use digital, user centered apps to capture extensive lived experience text data and deploy AI/ ML models to risk-stratify and proactively flag escalations and referrals. These data are complementary to in-clinic episodic data and bridges care systems and providers with different user cohorts with specific, actionable insights on mental health / substance abuse challenges and history. </p>
<p>Related statistics and our thinking are listed below</p>
<p>A 2020 study found that 65% of nonmetropolitan counties did not have access to psychiatrists. [A call to action to address rural mental health disparities, 2020. Morales et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7681156/] The Jeeva team recognizes that children and young adults, particularly those with minoritized identities, are severely impacted by the lack of mental healthcare access. Through the pandemic, there has been a loss of third spaces—a community space that is not school or work where one does not need to spend money to participate—and that third space for young adults has shifted online. The rise in isolation, adverse childhood experiences, and lack of community mental healthcare has potential to set up a volatile adulthood for Gen Z. Nearly 80% of young people (~36M in US), nearly a fifth of US population in general expreience issues; with LGBTQ+ and other communities experiencing disproportionately higher. </p>
<p>In rural areas, in-home assessments are commonly used for mental health screenings. This method creates a high barrier to mental health access. City density does not fully resolve this barrier either—we recognize that mental healthcare is still highly stigmatized and our goal is to lower the barrier at a young age to lower the burden on the understaffed healthcare system, should severe mental illness develop later in life. </p>
<p>Our approach is to start with the younger, text-friendly and digital savvy population before deploying these to the other groups so we can take the core data and algorithms, refine and prove the models of bridging infrastructure to the user before expanding. </p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>Our solution has two basic parts. As noted above, we are starting with Gen Z generation as a beachhead to prove out model's capabilities to comprehensively engage users, address their issues for efficacy so we can address the problem statement discussed above. </p>
<p>For the first part at the user level, it is a user centered mobile app with multiple modalities including (i) AI chatbot for 1x1 confidential 24 hour check-ins and CBT skills learning; (ii) AI enabled community forum for anonymous text based asynchronous peer validation, listening and social support around mental health challenges, with both clinician and AI moderation and (iii) tool kits and resliliency plans built into ""challenges"" that are suggested based on issues, emotional challenges uncovered through screening (GAD &amp; PHQ screens are built-in) and/or through chat. These were developed through 140 user interviews on 3 campuses (part of MIT's i-corps program) and are currently being piloted with 60 students on three large public university campuses in the US. The mobile app is available for your demo via either playstore on iOS or Android under jeeva digital health. </p>
<p>The second part is provider ie.,therapist or practice centric and currently being piloted thorugh a private behavioral health practice in licensed in TX and in CA. These are backend dashboard based systems integrated to the mobile apps where each therapist in the practice can assign users (patients) under their care specific weekly supplemental exercises and follow-through to be done between sessions including specific tools, techniques, readings, journaling, daily mood, anxiety and self-care readings. With these supplemental instructions and in conjunction with the app's community support, the hypothesis for the pilot is it will increase adherence, rate of efficacy and sustain the interventions as there will be increased peer motivation and accountability in completing and normalizing the interventions. Currently we have 14 users enrolled in this pilot with user consent. </p>
<p>Both these pilots will end in early fall '2023. By running these pilots, we solve specifically the technology of digital screening for anxiety, depression, early addiction and mapping user level and structural data capture, deidentifying these so good data, user cohorts,and secure opt-in based referrals is possible.  By reducing stigma through AI chatbot as well as by ""normalizing"" pervasive mental health challenges via anonymous community &amp; peer settings , we surface early symptoms and capture context and challenges in real-time. Our community forums have demonstrated that we are able to reach users that find mental health issues awkward and inaccessible - including minoritized members that identify themselves as ""ACE"" individuals or Asian males or Latina girls with adverse childhood experiences. The pilots are also helping us ensure we understand the undiagnosed (user pilots on campuses) vs. diagnosed (private practice) populations, can smooth out the referral, refine systems for content moderation, refine methods to increase adherance and levers for better efficacy outcomes.</p>","<p>Jeeva today in the pilot mode targets young adults, with a goal to use this as beachhead before expanding. Today, We are particularly focused on Gen Z, who are mostly in high school and college. Our goal is to have peer support on generation specific concerns, with the goal to reduce the experience of more severe mental illness in adulthood. Also wanting to prove our premise that early interventions will reduce burden on already under staffed, under resourced health systems, communities, schools, carefgivers etc. The impact will be significant as happy adjusted users will have higher academic and social success, get jobs or better jobs and understand self-regulation, self-care and sensible coping skills with the right education and well formed expecations on and need for therapy, medication, addiction etc. The impact on care-givers will be profound as roughly 50% of mental health suicides are due to those that didn't take up therapy or couldn't. Similarly, as a % of ER admits due to mental health, Gen Z is four timees more than other groups combined; so our impact can be measured in terms of ER admit reduction, the wait times reduction at providers. Today, it takes 10 to 12 years on average according to NAMI between first symptoms and treatment for mental health; we will reduce that. Also, marginalized communities tend to skip therapy or turn away due to stigma suffering the consequences as a result that we can address as well. </p>","<p>We are very well rounded team with complementary strengths and experiences.

As racial minority groups are least likely to seek mental healthcare, we ensure that our team reflects this diversity. Along with racial equity, we represent queer, disabled, low socioeconomic status, first generation students, immigrants, brown, black and caucasian, men and women and queer. <br />The team lead is an immigrant south asian (India) and has personal experience with mental health and as care giver for mental health of queer, disabled family member. As represented on our website, our team leads all represent various races and ethnicities across the entire spectrum and we actively source panelists from the user communities we serve and with the challenges that we try to tackle. In addition, we recruit and have a rotating panel of Gen Z students representing diverse lived experiences with mental health, substance including minoritized identities that evaluate our solution design, user experience, chatbot's conversational design, adapting the language for the audience and basically helping with the overall product experience in the context of audience using it day to day. We intend to keep replicating this as we expand to other markets; we already have six therapists looking at the platform and are in conversation with three universities and their student relations staff - similar to Dean of Student Living - to help us frame solutions for the stakeholders. We expect to do the same as we expand beyond this to behavioral health or community health markets. </p>","Increase local capacity and resilience in health systems, including the health workforce, supply chains, and primary care services","Providence, RI & Seattle, WA",United States,"Pilot: An organization testing a product, service, or business model with a small number of users",,"<p>Todday we serve ~60 students on 2 university campuses + a smaller 14 users (under six therapists) pilot with private behavioral health practice.

Jeeva aims to address the global mental health and substance crises by targeting both structural deficiencies in the mental health care system and user-specific needs. Structurally, the platform seeks to overcome challenges such as understaffing, lack of culturally appropriate training, and insufficient methods for community-level screening. On the user end, Jeeva focuses on patient-centered approaches, leveraging design thinking to encourage therapy-seeking behaviors and preventive self-care, especially among withdrawn and marginalized populations.

Jeeva is currently in the pilot stage of development, with the solution being tested among approximately 60 students across three U.S. university campuses and a smaller pilot involving 14 users in a private behavioral health practice setting. This dual approach comprises a user-centered mobile app offering AI chatbot interactions, AI-enabled community forums for peer support, and tailored resilience plans. The provider-centric component offers a backend system for therapists to monitor patients’ progress and engage them with supplemental exercises.

The solution primarily serves young adults, focusing on the Gen Z demographic in educational settings, with plans to expand its offerings to broader populations. The pilot aims to demonstrate Jeeva's efficacy in early intervention and bridging the gap between self-care and professional mental healthcare, with a significant focus on reducing stigma and facilitating earlier, more personalized care.

The team behind Jeeva is diverse and experienced, including professionals from mental health care, AI engineering, and product management backgrounds. Their experience and networks, including participation in multiple accelerators and mentorship programs, position them well to deliver and scale this solution.

Jeeva targets improving the responsiveness and capacity of health systems to address mental health needs at a local level, aligning with several UN Sustainable Development Goals, including Good Health and Well-being, Quality Education, and Reduced Inequalities. The pilot's impact and future goals focus on measurable outcomes such as reduction in wait times for mental health services, decrease in suicidality among marginalized populations, and broadening the accessibility of mental health interventions.

Overall, Jeeva represents a concerted effort to tackle the complex challenges of mental health care accessibility and personalization through innovative use of technology, with a sustainable plan for scaling and partnership outlined in their proposal."
76769,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,Afya-Link is an Electronic Health Records (EHR) system based on a decentralised architecture that provides an efficient means of bridging the gap between health institutions in both private and public sectors.,"<p>Data Health interoperability is a problem that remains open until now. The main question is how to provide open access to sensible data (health data), preserving personal data privacy, anonymity, and avoiding data misusage.</p>
<p>In a typical health care environment, a common scenario could be that a patient <strong><em>(A) </em></strong>needs some medical data while having a medical appointment at institution <strong><em>(B)</em></strong>, but the data was created during a previous appointment between <strong><em>(A) </em></strong>and <strong><em>(C)</em></strong>, and the data is kept by professional/institution <strong><em>(C)</em></strong>. In such a scenario it is difficult for patients to keep a better control of their own data and health professionals and institutions, such as hospitals, have access to patients data owned by others institutions.</p>
<p>Commonly, healthcare data is stored in a centralised system known as Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, which is often customised as per the healthcare providers requirements. This results in a fragmented approach to data storage, preventing ease of information sharing between systems, otherwise known as 'interoperability'. Instead, information ends up in silos that act as bottlenecks in the sharing of data, causing frustration among institutions, regulators, researchers and patients. This lack of standardisation and centralised storage approach results in two fundamental flaws, privacy and security.
</p>","<p>Afya-Link is an Electronic Health Records (EHR) system based on a decentralised architecture that provides an efficient means of bridging the gap between health institutions in both private and public sectors while enabling large-scale accessibility, keeping data privacy, reducing curating and mediating costs, as well as providing trust-less trust amongst health institutions/health professionals and between patients and health institutions/health professionals.</p>
<p> The software connects health institutions in a district, region and country level. Each institution updates record of test results, diagnosis and prescriptions for each patient that visits. Patients’ data are accessed by all institutions within the network while ensuring transparency and accountability at each step of the process. Smart contracts are used enable this process to run smoothly and the patient has total control and ownership of their data whereby no institution/ health professional is able to access patients’ data without their permission.</p>
<p>In a scenario, if the medical condition presented by the patient prevents them from being capable of granting permission to their records (e.g., because the patient is unconscious), we consider a “break the glass” mechanism, where a health professional is granted permission to access their records, given explicit account of the patient’s condition and presentation of required credentials of the professional, as well as publicly available information stating that the patient has explicitly declared that they would agree with this permission under clearly specified conditions.</p>
<p>Afya-Link is a decentralised system build in python. We provide APIs that return JSON data and hence it can integrate with different platforms both mobile and web different in different languages.
</p>
<p>We are developing packages for iOS (Swift), android (Kotlin) and Flutter(dart) for the ever-growing mobile development community.</p>
<p> Machine learning is employed to process the health data and provide better analysis of collected data. We are also working on developing TensorFlow models that would be used for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks.</p>","<p>Afya-Link has identified three distinct market segments that will be interested in the software product. These segments are the most likely consumers and contributors of the software. The segments are as follows:</p>
<p>1.     <strong>Health Institutions - </strong>Both public and private hospital are potential customers of the software because patient often visit different hospitals in different circumstances and time, also in case of referral there is need of communication and data exchange amongst institutions.
</p>
<p>2.     <strong>Government - </strong>For the government to ensure sustainable development of its people, they ought to know the health conditions of its citizen in order for them to properly plan and make decision that will have a positive impact to the society. Statistical data will help the government consider the regional control of infectious diseases such
</p>
<p>as measles, tuberculosis and cholera. It is important to track the incidence and prevalence of cases at the individual, or region level and prevent further spread of the diseases.
</p>
<p>3.     <strong>Software Developers </strong>Afya-Link is an open-source software that provides and allows developers to utilize and build products that are useful to the community. For-example a develop could build a mobile app to remind a patient of their doctor-appointments, health eating, exercising, health track etc. Afya-Link provides safe and secure APIs to patients’ data and information that will improve and personalize such apps, though a patient will have to grant access to such information.
</p>
<p>4.     <strong>Researchers </strong>- Medical students, independent researchers and institutions are in need of reliable and accurate medical data and processing information that would help them carryout their research with accuracy. Afya-Link understands the important of research in improving the healthcare field, with this in mind we provide such statistical data to researchers while maintaining privacy and integrity of patients.
</p>
<p>As much as we aim for Afya-Link to operate in the whole of Africa, our primary area of focus is Tanzania.</p>
<p>We are location at arguably the most vibrant city of the country and we believe its best location to launch our pilot software due various factors and conditions such as availability of health institution that already have the infrastructure to support this platform.
</p>
<p> 
Also, technology is picking up so fast in Dar Es Salaam and it’s a home of headquarters of various institutions both in medical and non-medical as well as technology companies.</p>","<p>Our co-founder team has well qualified software engineers and developers with a combined experience of 40 years in software development. Dennis Mwighusa, our CEO has a 15 years’ experience in software development with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering and a Postgraduate Education obtained from foreign countries, He has also been involved and lead several software projects and he currently actively pursuing AI, Data Science and Machine Learning. Elita Moye, our head of technology has a BSc. in Computer Engineering &amp; IT and currently pursuing MBA in IT management and a verse of software developed under her watch. Jonathan Masanja, is a web developer and software engineer with 8 years’ experience. Henry Lyamuya is a system designer and web developer for 8 years. Our team is also made up of young, bright and vibrant minds of computer science students from local and foreign universities who greatly increase innovation within the group.</p>
<p> We also are strong believers of open source because to build a fully decentralised system requires trust on several components, such as third- party institutions, agents and the information network itself. With this we argue that openness can be fundamental to reach the desired level of trust in the system. We encourage open innovation implying creation and involvement of a community of developers and users to solve social problems.</p>
<p>Apart from this solution we have built we have also participated in development of various solutions both between the government agencies and private sectors which are already in use and have impacted the community. Our developed solutions are cross-cutting serving different environments such as health, finance, agriculture, climate change etc.</p>","Enable informed interventions, investment, and decision-making by governments, local health systems, and aid groups",Dar es Salaam,Tanzania,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone","<p>We have so far made the following progresses to make sure that our developed solution goes into the market:</p>
<p>1. We have made all necessary revisions for regulatory &amp; privacy compliance. We have also introduced to 5 hospitals for implementation. Float Alpha model for virtual doctor consultation &amp; referrals.</p>
<p>2. We have created a Beta version of the data systemisation app and hoping to float into two pilot hospitals to implementation and testing. We have also developed an Alpha model for virtual doctor consultations and referrals.</p>
<p>3. We have also addressed any scalability concerns before introducing data systemisation to more hospitals. Launched Beta virtual doctor consultation and referrals.</p>

We are also welcoming investors who might be interested to join with us so as to help solve the community challenges in healthcare domain.</p>
<p>Guidance and Mentorship is also of a paramount importance, hence through this initiative we are also hoping that once qualified we shall be connected with potential mentors who will guide us professionally so as to make sure we have a product which is a top notch and will serve the purpose in which it is aimed for.</p>
<p>Through this initiative we are also sure that it will be a source for us to connect with a very powerful network of impact-minded leaders across industries and sectors, with dedication to make sure that we are finally achieving the purpose.</p>
<p>Through this initiative which is a renowned world class, we expect to receive different advices based on the requirements at that particular time but also this will be a source of us getting connected to different experts whereby we can also be able to share our experiences. This platform is also a source of us gaining more popularity and specifically our product which at the end will attract more users even beyond the country. </p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media)","No, Solve is the first network joined",,Google or other search engine,"<p>At first i was searching through google on where i can receive support for making our product more successfully. While searching it is when i came across with MIT Solve Innovation Challenges. I had to subscribe to your network so that i will be receiving different updates from your network.</p>
<p>The moment i realised you are providing support in the area of healthcare i was motivated to submit our challenge.</p>","<p>There are several software’s on the market that provide electronic health records management but they cover individual hospitals i.e., centralised systems. These systems provide solutions that eliminate paper work and improve record keeping for a particular hospital.</p>
<p>Health institutions are able to keep records of their patients’ data but this architecture does not provide room for collaboration between institutions and also a patient has no control of their data in anyway whatsoever. Also, when researchers want to use data stored in such system, there is always a difficulty because the data is raw (has not been processed into information), so researchers have to bear the burden of sorting, processing and preparing the raw data to suit their researches.
</p>
<p>Our aim is to connect all health institutions (Hospitals) and share their Electronic Health Records amongst themselves and other intended parties.
<br /></p>
<p>Taking into consideration that some hospitals have centralised system in place, our aim is not to replace them in the market but rather integrate them into this decentralised network.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we are providing Application Programming Interfaces commonly knowns as (APIs) so that hospitals using such softwares are able to connect and share data within the system without the need of replacing their software with new ones. These APIs ensure that data coming from various sources is consistent and satisfy a required standard.</p>
<p> For institutions (Hospitals) that do not have a system in place, we provide a customisable user-friendly system that they can sign-up and use for free.</p>
<p> Afya-Link also gives a patient total control and accessibility of their own health information at an instant. The patient may decide whether to allow their data to be used in other medical fields such as researches.</p>
<p> Since the software is open source, the system aims at having a strong growing community of contributors mainly software developers and researchers who will build a variety of solutions which will help improve the health care field enormously.</p>","<p>Since healthy people are more productive, and healthy infants and children can develop better and become productive adults. we want to work closely with the government to improve the health of its people.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we want to have government institutions that are directly involved in health should as the ministry of health onboard. Also, we want to partner with both private and public hospitals. Health insurance companies are potential partners and would be virtual in implementation of smart contracts.</p>
<p>We plan to have bootcamps and hackathon to allow the development community to develop as many products as possible that will be integrated with this platform.
</p>
<p>We are aiming to invest in signage, physical and digital advertising, email newsletters, search engine optimisation, social media outreach, TV and radio commercials.
</p>
<p>We shall also work to build a strong community for developers and researchers, the strength of the community will create trust and provide a platform for growth.
</p>
<p>We based our product pricing on a close study of all of our competitors in the market. Our software will be free for signups and use to health institutions. Affordable prices are designed for processed statistical data and charged per queries.</p>","3. Good Health and Well-being, 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure","<p>Since our platform is concerned with connecting all healthcare facilities so as to offer the best services, but also to connect key government players who make decisions, connecting healthcare professionals from different angles, researchers having access to various informations so as to conduct their researchers but also software developers to be able to utilise and build products that are useful to the community then at the end our progress is/will be measured by having met the SDG Goal Number 3 of which:</p>
<p>1. Under UN SDG 3.8 which is achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Some of these objectives will be met upon implementation of our platform. Under SDG 3.8.1 Coverage of essential health services: this will be met by decentralising the healthcare institutions. </p>
<p>2. Under SDG 3.b which states about supporting the research and development, this aligns with our solution to be offered services.</p>","<p>In order for our solution to create more impact to the problem we are addressing there are some of the issues that needs to be met. </p>
<p>We shall provide training and create awareness of the product for all stakeholders involved in the entire ecosystem. Every one will be informed on the best way can benefit from having access to the platform. This will be done by using Group facilitators who have a good understanding of the platform in place. The stakeholders to be involved in the training workshops include healthcare professionals, policy makers i.e., government officials, researchers, software developers etc.</p>
<p>Generating outcome standards requires patient data. The use of Afya-Link platform will generate raw patient data at unprecedented rates. The establishment of outcome standards will be needed to speed up measurement, which will allow institutions to collect and share data on outcomes more efficiently, and allow comparisons that will accelerate healthcare improvement.
</p>
<p>These outcome data can become even more impactful when applied to a theory of change framework.
</p>
<p>Measuring, reporting, and comparing health outcomes is a strategic approach that can drive better health outcomes for patients and populations. This approach can also drive improvement in care delivered by health teams. Improved outcomes and improved quality of care can be very motivating for teams. This also connects the interventions that improve health to a broader framework.

This approach aims to address issues of data interoperability, privacy, security, and access within the healthcare setting.

Afya-Link serves several key demographic segments: health institutions, government bodies, software developers, and researchers. Its operational model is based on a system where health institutions can update and share patient records, including test results, diagnoses, and prescriptions, within a network. This ensures patient data is accessible across various institutions, with provisions in place for patient consent and emergency access protocols, such as the “break the glass” mechanism for emergency situations where patient consent cannot be obtained.

The solution is currently at the prototype stage, with a developed Beta version ready for piloting in two hospitals. It utilizes Python for the decentralized system structure, offers APIs in multiple languages for integration with different platforms, and employs machine learning and TensorFlow models for data analysis.

The team headquartered in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, consists of software engineers and developers with extensive experience in software development, AI, data science, and machine learning. They are committed to open-source principles, aiming for a community-driven approach to further develop and refine the solution.

Afya-Link seeks to involve various stakeholders, including hospitals, government institutions, developers, and researchers, in its implementation. The solution's open-source nature is intended to foster innovation and collaboration in the development of additional health-related applications.

Regarding financial sustainability, Afya-Link plans to offer the software for free to health institutions while generating revenue through the provision of processed statistical data to researchers and developers. The team is also exploring partnerships, fundraising, and investor support to secure financial backing for the project.

In conclusion, the proposal presents Afya-Link as a prototype EHR system designed to improve health data interoperability and access through a decentralized network, with a specific focus on catering to various stakeholders within the health ecosystem in Tanzania."

77053,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,"Building a community of young Nigerians ready to combat cancer in the country using research, health communications, advocacy, and technology as tools.","<p>The specific problem that the Youth Against Cancer Initiative (YACI) project aims to solve is the low cancer awareness and education, research, and advocacy in Nigeria, particularly among youths. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and the burden of the disease in Africa is expected to double by 2040. Currently, 56% of new cancer cases are from developing countries (Africa inclusive), and it is projected that by 2030 that 76% of new cancer cases will be from this developing nations. In Nigeria, the most populous African nation with an estimated 200 million people, cancer incidence and mortality rates are rising, but cancer control efforts are still inadequate, and there is a lack of awareness and education about cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment.</p>
<p>The scale of the problem is significant, with cancer incidence and mortality rates on the rise in Nigeria. In 2020, an estimated 102,000 new cancer case and 77,000 cancer deaths occurred in Nigeria. This figure is projected to rise. Breast cancer (27%) is the most prevalent, followed by cervix uteri (14%), liver (12%), prostate (12%), and colorectum (4.1%). While breast cancer has a 20% death rate, the liver (16%), prostate (13%), cervix uteri (12%), and colorectum (4.4%). Breast cancer is now the top cause of mortality in Nigeria, followed by liver cancer and prostate cancer. Cancer is becoming more common in most parts of the world, although there are significant disparities between developed nations and developing ones such as Nigeria. Although incidence rates remain highest in more developed locations, fatality rates in less developed countries are significantly higher due to a lack of early detection and access to treatment facilities.</p>
<p> Approximately 20% of the population of Africa and a little bit above half the population of West Africa, Nigeria inclusive contributed 15% to the estimated 681,000 new cases of cancer that occurred in Africa in 2008. Just as the situation in the rest of the developing countries, a large proportion of the increase in incidence of cancer in Nigeria is due to increasing life expectancy, reduced risk of death from infectious diseases, increasing prevalence of smoking, physical inactivity, failed healthcare system, low cancer awareness and education, obesity as well as changing dietary and lifestyle patterns. </p>
<p>Over 70% of the cancer patients present late stages (III &amp; IV) with few patients having access to the limited treatment facilities in the country. More people are diagnosed of cancer at advanced stages because so many people in Nigeria have been whitewashed with myths and misinformation such as that cancer is a white man's disease and so many other misinformation. </p>
<p>The project's solution aims to address these factors by empowering youths to raise awareness about cancer, conduct research, and advocate for policy changes to improve cancer control efforts in Nigeria. Through partnerships with healthcare providers, policymakers, and other stakeholders, the project seeks to develop sustainable cancer control programs that can improve cancer outcomes in Nigeria.</p>","<p>Cancer is a growing health concern in the world and in Nigeria, with incidence and mortality rates on the rise. Despite this, there is a lack of awareness and education about cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment. To address this challenge, the YACI project is aimed at improving cancer awareness, research, and advocacy in Nigeria leveraging technology and health communications.</p>
<p>The project is aimed at achieving this via four (4) frontiers:</p>
<p>1. Research </p>
<p>2. Health Communications and Technology</p>
<p>3. Outreaches and Advocacy</p>
<p>4. Human Capacity Development</p>
<p>The project shall leverage technology by the development of a mobile app that provides updates on the latest trends in cancer research, prevention, and treatment. This app will be a valuable tool for raising awareness and educating people about cancer. The app will also provide tips on how to stay fit and healthy, which can reduce the risk of developing cancer.</p>
<p>The app will be developed by Nigerian university undergraduate students who will be trained on app development and health communications. These youths will be responsible for updating the app with the latest information on cancer research and trends. The app will also allow users to ask questions and engage with healthcare professionals to learn more about cancer prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>To complement the app, we will also organize cancer control and awareness programs in high schools and universities in Nigeria. The programs will be led by the Nigerian youth champions, undergraduate students who must have been trained in health communications so as to reduce misinformation during outreaches. The programs will educate students about cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment. This will help to create a generation of young people who are knowledgeable about cancer and can advocate for better cancer control policies.</p>
<p>Understanding the importance of research in cancer eradication, this project will train undergraduate students in research because involving undergraduate students in cancer research can contribute to the fight against cancer by providing them with valuable skills and experience. Students can assist in various aspects of research, gaining exposure to techniques and concepts in cancer research, and working with established researchers. Moreover, this involvement can inspire students to pursue further education and careers in cancer research, fostering a new generation of passionate and dedicated researchers.</p>
<p>The project will also leverage local and social media to spread cancer awareness messages across Nigeria. Social media platforms like Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram will be used to reach a broader audience with cancer awareness messages. The project will also partner with local media such as radio, and TV outlets to produce and broadcast cancer awareness content across Nigeria.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the project aims to create a sustainable and impactful solution to low cancer awareness in Nigeria. By empowering Nigerian youths to lead the charge against cancer, leveraging technology, health communications, and advocacy, the project will create a generation of young people who are knowledgeable about the disease and can advocate for better cancer control policies. </p>","<p>Youth Against cancer Initiative (YACI) is designed to serve the Nigerian population, using the youths who are although at  low risk of developing cancer due to lifestyle choices and lack of awareness about the disease. The project targets high schools and universities in Nigeria where young people can be educated and empowered to lead the fight against cancer.</p>
<p>Currently, cancer awareness and control programs are not widely available in Nigeria, leaving many people at risk of developing the disease or not receiving the care they need. The lack of awareness and education about cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment means that many people do not know how to protect themselves from the disease, nor do they know how to seek care if they develop symptoms. As a result, many people in Nigeria are diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage, when treatment options are limited and costly.</p>
<p>The project will directly and meaningfully improve the lives of Nigerian people by providing them with the knowledge and skills they need to protect themselves from cancer. The mobile app developed by the youth champions will serve as a source of up-to-date information on cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment, empowering young and old people alike to make informed choices about their health. The app will also provide tips on how to stay fit and healthy, which can reduce the risk of developing cancer.</p>
<p>The cancer control and awareness programs organized by YACI will reach high schools and universities in Nigeria, where young people can be educated and empowered to lead the fight against cancer. The programs will educate young people about cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment, enabling them to take an active role in advocating for better cancer control policies. By engaging young people in the fight against cancer, the project will create a sustainable solution to the problem of low cancer awareness in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Overall, the project's solution will have a significant impact on the lives of Nigerian youths by providing them with the knowledge and skills they need to protect themselves from cancer. By creating a generation of young people who are knowledgeable about the disease and can advocate for better cancer control policies, the project will ultimately contribute to reducing the incidence and mortality rates of cancer in Nigeria and improve the overall health outcomes of the Nigerian people.</p>","<p>As an undergraduate student who is passionate about cancer eradication through advocacy, health communications, and research, I and my team have the potential to make a significant impact in the fight against cancer in Nigeria, and subsequently the world at large. While I may not have the same level of academic or professional experience as some other individuals, I and my team's proximity to the communities we are serving and our passion for the cause give us a unique perspective and energy that can be a powerful force for change and impact.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of being an undergraduate student is that I am part of a generation that is deeply connected to technology and social media.

<p>Firstly, the project has a specific design and layout that has been developed to address the problem of low cancer awareness. The project team has conducted extensive research to identify the root causes of low cancer awareness in Nigeria and to determine the best strategies to increase awareness. Based on this research, the team has come to the realization that there has been little to no cancer awareness and education among youths in Nigeria and that the development of an app will help update these young ones about the latest trends on cancer and provide information on how to keep fit and healthy. Additionally, the team has planned to organize cancer control and awareness programs in high schools and universities in Nigeria, as well as using local and social media to spread awareness about cancer. We decided to use these mediums because it's on these platforms (web, schools and socials) that a good number of youths can be seen easily. The project design is based on feedback from stakeholders, research, and industry standards.</p>
<p>Secondly, the project has a specific functionality that has been developed to meet the needs of the end-users. The app, for example, will provide a range of features such as cancer awareness information, health and fitness tips, and regular updates on the latest cancer research. The app will be user-friendly, accessible, and tailored to the needs of the Nigerian young population. The awareness programs in schools and universities will also be developed to ensure they are appropriate for the target age groups and educational levels.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the project has been tested to ensure that it meets the desired objectives and functions effectively. The project team shall conduct extensive testing on the app to ensure it works as intended and is accessible to the target audience. Additionally, the team has conducted pilot cancer awareness programs in a number of schools here in Enugu to test the effectiveness of the program and identify any areas for improvement. The team has also carried out extensive surveys and focus groups to gather feedback from end-users to refine the design and functionality of the research and health communications training for undergraduate students which shall be handy during the awareness programs.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the project incorporates feedback from stakeholders and end-users to improve its design, functionality, and overall user experience. The project team has engaged with a range of stakeholders, including medical professionals, cancer survivors, and non-profit organizations, to ensure the project is relevant and effective. The team has also involved end-users in the development process, using their feedback to refine the programs to ensure they meet their needs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the cancer awareness project described is a prototype because it has been designed, developed, and tested to address the specific problem of low cancer awareness in Nigeria. The project has a specific design and functionality that has been developed based on research, stakeholder feedback, and industry standards. The project has also been tested and refined to ensure it meets the desired objectives and functions effectively.

Over the years, the few cancer awareness programs in Nigeria were focused on educating adults about cancer. Knowing the importance of youth in the fight against public health issues such as cancer, my project will focus on creating change from the grassroots, starting with youths mainly high school and university students. The youth are known for their curiosity, inquisitiveness, quick learning ability, and their willingness to pass on their knowledge to others. With these qualities, we can build a community of well-informed youth who are taking action against cancer. Information, they say, is power, and my project seeks to empower youths with this valuable asset - information. Therefore, while other organizations educate adults about cancer, my project will focus on educating the youth so as to build a community of cancer-aware youth and advocates who are grounded in research and health communications.</p>","<p>In the next one year, I will measure progress using the following metrics:</p>
<p>1. Train and empower 80 university biomedical students who are passionate about reducing the cancer burden in Nigeria (20 every 3 months) in the areas of health communications, research, and cancer advocacy. <br />2. Visit 10 schools and impact between 2,000 - 5000 students, with each school having an average of 200 and 500 students. <br />3. Get feedback from schools on how much the students are implementing what they learned during the campaign, most especially engagement in physical activities and monthly breast self-examination. This will be done through questionnaires. Their response will help us know how effective the program is.  <br />4. Reach up to 100,000 youth through handbills and our mobile app, social, and local media outlets. <br />5. 40% increase in cancer literacy among high school students in Enugu, Nigeria.  </p>

The primary problem addressed involves overcoming healthcare access barriers, managing chronic diseases, improving mental health services, enhancing maternal and child health care, and harnessing technology and innovation in healthcare.

The solution involves collaboration between Danish healthcare students from Region Hovedstaden and Copenhagen University, and healthcare students in Pakistan and Bangladesh, facilitated by the Nordic Innovations Centre located in Pakistan. The Denmark/Pakistan IT Entrepreneurs Forum (DPEF) will apply agile development methodologies to create minimum viable products (MVPs), with a goal to offer these solutions to EU companies for further funding and scaling. A key aspect of the solution includes establishing a health-tech innovation platform and a marketplace for equity sharing to support female health entrepreneurs.

This project aims to serve the healthcare systems in Denmark, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, specifically targeting mental healthcare patients, chronic patients, and female healthcare students in these countries. Furthermore, it intends to mobilize a network of expat spouses for business development roles, providing coaching and market strategy access to female-led healthcare startups.

The DPEF, with its ties to IT and health-tech ecosystems and contacts in the health sectors of Denmark, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, leads this initiative. The project has progressed to the prototype stage, distinguished by signed agreements with the Nordic Innovations Centre in Islamabad and initiatives to roll out health tech collaborations. A pilot project is expected to commence in 2023, launching a global health case challenge in partnership with Copenhagen University.

At present, the project has not yet served individuals but aims to optimize healthcare solutions in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Denmark. The team seeks partnerships and support in legal matters, product/service distribution, public relations, and technology to realize their vision.

The innovation lies in the cross-cultural collaboration of female healthcare innovators to develop globally scalable health solutions, drawing on Danish healthcare expertise to address significant challenges in Bangladesh and Pakistan. The project aligns with several UN Sustainable Development Goals, including Good Health and Well-being, Gender Equality, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and Partnerships for the Goals. 

The business model revolves around establishing healthcare co-creations across cultures, with financial sustainability expected through grants, investment from health companies, and a commission and equity structure for participating startups."

According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), in 2015, there were 2.1 billion people in need of care (1.9 billion children under the age of 15, of whom 0.8 billion were under six years of age, and 0.2 billion older persons aged or above their healthy life expectancy). By 2030, the number of care recipients is predicted to reach 2.3 billion, driven by an additional 0.1 billion older persons and an additional 0.1 children aged 6 to 14 years.
  </p>
<p>Secondly, <strong>S7 CARE</strong> alleviates the difficulties professional parents (especially women working away from home) have in joining the labour because of the need to fulfill their domestic care responsibilities. According to the ILO, in 2018, 606 million women of working age have declared themselves to be unavailable for employment or not seeking a job due to unpaid care work, while 41 million men are inactive for the same reason.
  </p>
<p>Lastly, <strong>S7 CARE </strong>combats the challenges job seekers and care workers face within the social care sector. In a Handbook for Domestic Workers by Horizons Femmes 2011, less than 5% of domestic workers in Cameroon have an employment contract, 3 domestic workers out of 4 (72%) earn less than the minimum pay wage (50 U.S.D) monthly and over 90% of employers agree that domestic workers often suffer acts of violence.

SRH refers to the ability of individuals to make informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive lives and to access high-quality healthcare services to support those decisions. The core aspects to SRH includes menstrual hygiene, sexually transmitted infections, gender-based violence and maternal mortality. Each one of these are larger issues and need focussed attention. The ability to access essential health services is also a part of enabling SRH. Sadly even though the young generation are a huge part of the low and middle income countries such as India, their requirements for the SRH are more often overlooked, especially those living in slums. Women still face barriers to accessing SRH services due to factors such as stigma, discrimination, and lack of access to quality healthcare services. It is essential that we work towards eliminating these barriers and ensuring that all women have access to the comprehensive SRH services they need to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.<br />Even though India has made huge strides in ensuring SRH through its National Family Planning Programme and Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (National Adolescent Health Programme), there are critical gaps in meeting Sexual and Reproductive Health outcomes.

Beneficiaries users are able to easily and comfortably access and understand higher quality SRH education. This includes ensuring that factors such as distance/geography, language/dialect, educational and economic status, and literacy-levels do not pose barriers to access or comprehension.<br />● Increased acceptance by girls and boys that menstruation is normal and healthy.

<p> The first part of our solution involves teaching these women about sexual reproductive health by providing access to education. We will target girls in these vulnerable areas to break away from the culture of silence and increase their knowledge base, helping them to better understand their own bodies and reproductive systems. We will also support both girls and boys to address myths, taboos, restrictive perceptions and social norms surrounding sexual reproductive health.<br />The second part of our solution is to encourage the adoption of hygiene and quality sexual reproductive health products, while ensuring affordability. Through our Adopt concept, we aim to provide these women with access to affordable hygiene products. By generating revenue from the sale of these products, we will also ensure financial stability for our proposed solution. Our goal is to create a habit of using hygiene products, as we believe that if a woman adopts these products and becomes accustomed to using them, she is more likely to continue using them.<br />The third part of our solution involves ensuring that women have access to critical health decisions through their smartphones, by exposing them to the services provided by the TMI App. By offering education, affordable hygiene products, and access to health services, we believe that we can help improve the overall sexual reproductive health of women living in vulnerable areas, such as slums.</p>","Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Human Capital (e.g. sourcing talent, board development), Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)","Yes, this solution is already (or has been in the past) a part of other networks",<p>Rani work an initiative by Myna Mahila</p>,Google or other search engine,<p>We got to know about the Global Challenge through the website</p>,"<p>Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) is the right of every woman. Sexual Reproductive Health is also the most stigmatized topic for vulnerable communities. Over 3.4 million women in India have a desire to avoid pregnancy - of which 94% are married women (Murro et al.). In India, 71% of girls report not knowing about menstruation before their first period (Rehman). Furthermore, 70% of women in India say their families cannot afford sanitary pads (FSG). Moreover, 23 million girls drop out of school annually due to lack of proper menstrual hygiene.</p><p>Through the Teach Menses India Intervention, Myna Mahila Foundation intends to provide a<br />holistic one-stop solution to problems related to education, adoption and accessibility regarding sexual reproductive health, by addressing the barriers for it in a systematic manner. TMI will be delivered via two channels: (1) Physical Training Sessions in colleges and high schools where trained school staff would lead class sessions around the students’ health and gender attitudes. (2) Online through a mobile digital health application, “TMI App” where Myna Didi will lead a curriculum, and provide personalized support via female doctors.<br />This will ensure Knowledge, Adoption and Accessibility about Sexual Reproductive Health for girls at an early age to make informed decisions. The goal of the intervention is as follows:</p>
<p> ● Teach: To bring about a change in knowledge, attitude and practices in terms of SRH by providing access to education<br />○ Target girls in the areas of intervention break away from the culture of silence.<br />○ Increase their knowledge base to understand their own body and reproduction<br />system<br />○ Support girls and boys to address myths, taboos, restrictive perceptions and social norms.<br />● Adopt: Encouraging the adoption of hygiene and quality SRH products and not compromising the affordability of the products and services.<br />● Access: Ensuring that women are able to control their critical health decisions through their smartphones by exposing them to the services provided by TMI App<br />The innovation in the solution is as follows:<br />- There have hardly been any interventions which focus on three core aspects of the SRH - Knowledge, Adoption and Accessibility<br />- There have not been any interventions in the space of Sexual Reproductive Health which have been delivered in the hybrid mode - physical trainings and virtual setups<br />- The sustainability of the program lies in the fact that the on-boarded girls will be engaged till the end of their lifetime through TMI App<br />- The training sessions are not only for SRH - but also to ensure mental health hence the sessions include the topics such as Importance of Mental Health, Importance of Nutrition, Importance of Exercise and Role of Mental Health Counsellor</p>","<p>Impact Goals for next year</p>
<p> ● Access to a quality and affordable menstrual product. Beneficiaries are able to easily, comfortably, and regularly access and use a higher quality menstrual product. Factors such as cost, distance/geography, education, economic status, literacy-levels, product maintenance, and unfamiliarity with the product type will not pose a problem in adoption<br />● Access to quality and appropriate SRH education. Beneficiaries users are able to easily and comfortably access and understand higher quality SRH education. This includes ensuring that factors such as distance/geography, language/dialect, educational and economic status, and literacy-levels do not pose barriers to access or comprehension.<br />● Increased acceptance by girls and boys that menstruation is normal and healthy. Improved understanding and attitudes by girls and boys on the basics of menstruation and its importance as an indicator of a healthy reproductive system. This also includes a reduction in negative social norms and taboos surrounding menstruation found at the societal-level.<br />● Increased girls’ participation and attendance during her years of education . Young girls have increased participation and engagement in the classroom due to increased confidence in the reliability of the menstrual product they are using. Improved product security may enhance girls’ abilities to engage with teachers and peers in classroom activities by reducing fears about blood stains on their clothing.<br />● Increased utilization of Access to health services. Since the girls now know the importance of taking care of their own sexual and reproductive health and will also be able to identify signs and symptoms incase of any deviance due to the health education session, they will not hesitate to book an appointment with the doctor/counselor according to their need thereby enabling them to treat themselves at an early stage.<br />Impact Goals for next five years<br />● Improved educational engagement. Improved educational engagement can enhance the academic success and confidence of girls in addition to strengthening their college -based social networks. Ultimately this may impact their grade progression and graduation completion rates.<br />● Improved population health. Girls’ education improves population level health outcomes, such as by reducing fertility rates, increasing contraceptive usage, reducing the</p>
<p> risk of becoming infected with HIV/AIDs and other sexually transmitted diseases, and positively impacts the health of girls’ future families, such as increasing children’s vaccine rates.<br />● Improved engagement by girls and women in society through the diminishment of taboos and social restrictions. Girls may experience an increased capacity and confidence managing their activities of daily living during their monthly menstruation, including reduced menstrual related stress, improved ability to engage in college, and decreased social segregation from community, religious and household activities.<br />● Gender Equality: Promoting SRH is an important way to protect girls' dignity, privacy, bodily integrity, and, as a result, their self efficacy. Awareness of SRH contributes to the creation of a nondiscriminatory and gender-equal environment in which female voices are heard, girls have choices about their future, and women have opportunities to become leaders and managers.</p>","3. Good Health and Well-being, 5. Gender Equality","<p>This initiative is directly linked to two different UN SDGs - Goal 3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages and Goal 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Hence in the short run we will be measuring the impact of the intervention on bringing about an attitudinal change on gender stereotypes and shed light on gender inclusivity. This will be a qualitative survey and will help the participants in understanding the gender stereotypes and unlearn the myths related to the topic. The intervention will also promote Menstrual Hygiene Management, thus helping out the participants to break the vicious circle of myths, taboos and stigma around MHM. The intervention will provide access to one stop solution, thus helping in increased knowledge on Health, Increased access to services and Increased access to hygienic and affordable products. Participants will be sensitized to know the importance of physical, mental and social health and also the importance of eating healthy and nutritious food along with exercise and its effect on the aging process. As a result of this intervention, girls health seeking behavior on SRH becomes her self regulatory behavior and thereby her overall health is improved</p><p>Due to the prioritization of the girl’s health, it is expected that the school dropouts due to Menstrual problems will reduce drastically. They would be able to continue their education, seek better employment opportunities and thus become financially independent - a catalyst for gender equality</p>",,"<p>Our technology is the Teach Menses India App, which is a mobile application providing holistic one-stop solution to the beneficiaries from the vulnerable communities who do not even have a confidante with whom they can share their Sexual Reproductive Health related issues, let alone visiting a doctor. Given this in purview, we wanted to design a mobile application which will help them discuss their problems without any hesitation.</p><p>Furthermore, during the ideation phase, the pandemic struck, and the need to launch the app became more prominent. The number of calls on the Myna helpline increased three-fold since the confusion and consciousness set in during the pandemic for women in the most low-income patriarchal families. Most concerns were related to SRH, especially MHM-related queries, which could have been fatal in many cases. With the intention to provide door-to-door services for women who become prone to sexual diseases without proper care, sanitation, and health products. Myna’s effort was to bring them into mainstream health care as a part of Universal Health Coverage. Based on this, the Myna Health App was designed with three motives:<br />● Promote Awareness: The Myna Health App was designed to promote awareness amongst women about the biology of their well-being and their social and psychological well-being. In the M-Health App, various short animated videos make them aware of the health aspects focussing on physical health and mental health<br />● Provide Doctor Consultations: Most women in the areas that Myna focused on were either unaware of the doctors in and around their areas or too shy to approach them by themselves, usually relying on the male family members. M-Health App eliminates any such need and ensures that booking doctor’s appointments for these women is just a click away. Furthermore, if the women are too shy to even step out of their homes, M-health App has a feature of private chat to give them anonymity to disclose their problems and take corrective action towards their well-being.<br />● Provide door-to-door health products: Even today, when one accesses a sanitary napkin from a medical shop, the first thing that they do is wrap it in a newspaper before passing it on to the customer. This is the kind of stigma that women face for their SRH. Hence, M-Health App has a feature where women can place orders for essential healthcare products at the App to receive them at their doorstep.</p>",A new business model or process that relies on technology to be successful,,Behavioral Technology,India,India,Nonprofit,,"Myna Mahila has 48 full time staff, three part time staff members and 8 consultants.

We ensure diversity from top down in our cultural and economic differences. Further, we encourage perspectives to be heard in bottom up order. During team debriefs, people working most closely with workers speak first and they are given the most air time. We constantly relate back to our values during the meetings every time there seems to be diversions, and we regularly engage in open and honest dialogue (including mistakes/failure). If our team believes in diversity and inclusivity themselves, we would be equitable in recruiting workers of different ethnicities and cultures for Myna. We provide training to be unbiased in the recruitment process to ensure we are not discriminating. For instance, our Muslim coordinators visit Hindu homes to speak about the job, and vice versa. When our diverse team talks to each other so openly and freely about their lives, others around them tend to open up as well.</p><p>Finally, we need to invest a lot more in leadership development of our team members, providing them with mentorship to grow more confident of themselves and their team.</p>","<p>Our main target audience is women who live in vulnerable areas, such as slums.

77758,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,Neural Avifauna is a mental health technology company that uses AI and Self-Therapy to provide individuals with alternate therapeutics.,"<p>The problem that I am working to solve is the lack of access and affordability of mental health care for millions of people in the U.S. and globally. Mental health is a vital component of well-being but is often neglected, stigmatized, or underfunded by health systems and governments. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in four people in the world will be affected by a mental or neurological disorder at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions. However, only a small fraction of those who need mental health services receive them, especially in low- and middle-income countries where resources are scarce and barriers are high.</p>
<p>In the U.S., mental health conditions are common and widespread, affecting more than one in five adults (57.8 million) in 2021. However, less than half of them (46.2%) received treatment in 2020, indicating a significant gap between need and care. The reasons for this gap include lack of insurance coverage, high costs, stigma, discrimination, shortage of providers, and cultural or linguistic barriers. Moreover, some groups are more vulnerable and marginalized than others regarding mental health issues, such as racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, people experiencing homelessness or incarceration, veterans, refugees, and survivors of trauma or violence.</p>
<p>My solution addresses this problem by providing an alternative therapy opportunity that uses sound and vibration (haptics) to help individuals cope with their mental health struggles. Sound-vibration therapy is based on the premise that sounds waves and vibrations can positively influence the brain and body, such as reducing stress, anxiety, depression, pain, and insomnia; enhancing mood, memory, attention, and creativity; and promoting relaxation, healing, and well-being. My solution leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and self-therapy techniques to deliver personalized and interactive sound vibration interventions that can be accessed through a smartphone app or a wearable device. My solution aims to make mental health care more accessible, affordable, effective, and inclusive for people who face barriers to conventional therapy or prefer a different self-care approach.</p>
<p>The scale of the problem that my solution targets is enormous and urgent. According to the WHO, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting more than 264 million people. Moreover, mental disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicide, which is the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds globally. The economic burden of mental disorders is also staggering. According to a study by the Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development, the cumulative global impact of mental disorders in terms of lost economic output will amount to $16.3 trillion between 2010 and 2030.</p>","<p>My solution is a mental health technology that uses sound and vibration (haptics) to provide individuals with an alternative therapy opportunity to help themselves with their struggles. It combines a smartphone app and a wearable device that deliver personalized and interactive sound-vibration interventions based on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-therapy techniques.</p>
<p>The smartphone app allows users to choose from different categories of sound-vibration therapy, such as relaxation, meditation, mood enhancement, pain relief, or sleep improvement. The app also collects data from the user’s feedback, preferences, goals, and biometric sensors (such as heart rate, blood pressure, or skin conductance) to tailor the interventions to each individual’s needs and progress. The app uses AI algorithms to analyze the data and generate optimal sound vibration patterns for the user.</p>
<p>The wearable device is a flexible band that can be worn on different body parts, such as the wrist, the neck, or the chest. The device connects to the smartphone app via Bluetooth and emits sounds and vibrations that match the sound vibration patterns generated by the app. The device also has sensors that measure the user’s physiological responses to the sound-vibration therapy and send them back to the app for further analysis and adjustment.</p>
<p>The sound-vibration therapy works by stimulating the brain and body in positive ways through sound waves and vibrations. Sound waves are audible frequencies that can influence the brain’s activity, such as inducing relaxation, alertness, or creativity. Vibrations are tactile frequencies that can influence the body’s sensations, such as reducing pain, tension, or inflammation. Together, sound waves and vibrations can create a synergistic effect that enhances the physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being of the user.</p>
<p>The technology behind my solution is based on scientific research and evidence that support the benefits of sound-vibration therapy for mental health. For example, a study published in the Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine found that an hourlong sound meditation using Tibetan singing bowls helped people reduce stress, anxiety, depression, anger, fatigue, and pain while increasing a sense of spiritual well-being. Another study published in Psychology Today found that rhythm in particular (over melody), can relieve physical pain. Moreover, a review of 400 published scientific articles on music as medicine found strong evidence that music has mental and physical health benefits in improving mood and reducing stress.</p>
<p>My solution is simple, innovative, and impactful. It is simple because it only requires a smartphone app and a wearable device that are easy to use and accessible to anyone. It is innovative because it combines sound and vibration (haptics) with AI and self-therapy to create a personalized, interactive experience that adapts to each user’s needs and goals. It is impactful because it can help millions of people who suffer from mental health conditions or who want to improve their mental well-being by providing them with an alternative therapy opportunity that is accessible, affordable, effective, and inclusive.</p>","<p>The target population whose lives I am working to directly and meaningfully improve are individuals who are not able to get proper mental health care and ones who do not find in-person therapy super efficient. These include people who face barriers such as lack of insurance coverage, high costs, stigma, discrimination, shortage of providers, and cultural or linguistic barriers. These also include people who prefer a different approach to self-care that is more discreet, personalized, interactive, and empowering.<br /></p>
<p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), less than half of U.S. adults with mental illness received treatment in 2020, indicating a significant gap between need and care. Moreover, some groups are more vulnerable and marginalized than others regarding mental health issues, such as racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, people experiencing homelessness or incarceration, veterans, refugees, and survivors of trauma or violence. For example, Black Americans are 20% more likely to experience serious mental health problems than the general population, but only one in three Black Americans who need mental health care receive it. This is partly due to historical and present-day racism, discrimination, and mistrust in the healthcare system.</p>
<p>My solution addresses the needs of this target population by providing them with an alternative therapy opportunity that uses sound and vibration (haptics) to help them cope with their mental health struggles. My solution leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and self-therapy techniques to deliver personalized and interactive sound-vibration interventions that can be accessed through a smartphone app or a wearable device. My solution aims to make mental health care more accessible, affordable, effective, and inclusive for people who face barriers to conventional therapy or prefer a different self-care approach.</p>
<p>To better understand this target population's needs and preferences, I interviewed 20+ people from different backgrounds and contexts, such as students, HR professionals, parents, veterans, refugees, and survivors of trauma.

<p>As the team leads, I have a personal connection to the problem and the solution. I have struggled with mental health issues myself and had to take a break from school to cope with them. However, I was limited in accessing therapy because my parents wouldn’t be able to help. Therefore, I had to get creative and find ways to help myself. One of the ways that helped me was listening to soothing sounds and feeling their vibrations on my body. I found that this helped me relax, calm down, and feel better. I also learned about self-therapy techniques that helped me cope with my negative thoughts and emotions. I realized that sound-vibration therapy could be a powerful tool for self-care and healing for many people who face similar barriers or challenges to accessing mental health care. That marks the beginning of the project.</p>
<p>While currently searching, the goal is for my team to consist of four other members who have different backgrounds and skills that complement each other and contribute to the design and delivery of the solution. They are:</p>
<ul><li><p>A software engineer with experience developing mobile applications and artificial intelligence algorithms. They are responsible for creating the smartphone app that delivers sound-vibration interventions based on the user’s data and feedback.</p></li><li><p>A hardware engineer with experience designing and building wearable devices and sensors. They are responsible for creating the wearable device that emits sounds and vibrations and measures the user’s physiological responses.</p></li><li><p>A sound therapist with experience using sound-vibration therapy for various mental health conditions. They are responsible for providing the content and guidance for the sound-vibration interventions based on scientific research and evidence.</p></li><li><p>A community organizer who has experience in working with marginalized and underserved populations. They are responsible for engaging with the target population and ensuring that their needs, preferences, and input are incorporated into the design and implementation of the solution.</p></li></ul><p>All of us share a passion for mental health and a vision for making it more accessible, affordable, effective, and inclusive for everyone. We also share a proximity to the communities we are serving, as we have either experienced mental health issues ourselves or have close family members or friends who have. </p>
<p>We have also involved them in testing and refining our prototype and collecting data on its usability, feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. We have also established partnerships with local organizations that serve these communities, such as schools, shelters, clinics, and nonprofits. </p>
<p>By doing so, we ensure that the design and implementation of our solution is meaningfully guided by the communities’ input, ideas, and agendas. We also ensure that our solution is culturally sensitive, linguistically appropriate, respectful of diversity, and responsive to change.</p>","Enable continuity of care, particularly around primary health, complex or chronic diseases, and mental health and well-being.","West Palm Beach, FL",United States,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone","<p>My solution is a prototype rather than a concept because it has been developed and tested with real users and data. A concept is an idea that has not been implemented or validated yet. A prototype is a preliminary version of a product or service that has been built and evaluated to demonstrate its feasibility and potential.</p>
<p>I have built a prototype of my smartphone app and wearable device that deliver personalized and interactive sound-vibration interventions based on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-therapy techniques. I have used various tools and platforms to create a beta app and the device, such as Python and AI-tools (i.e. GPT-4). I have also used different types of sound-vibration therapy tools and instruments, such as singing bowls, gongs, bells, and vibration machines. </p>
<p>I have tested my prototype with real users and data to assess its usability, feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. I have conducted interviews, surveys, focus groups, and workshops with potential users from different backgrounds and contexts to learn about their experiences, expectations, and feedback. I have also involved them in testing and refining my prototype and collecting data on its usability, feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. I have used various methods and metrics to measure these outcomes, such as user satisfaction ratings, task completion rates, error rates, system performance indicators, physiological responses, psychological assessments, and qualitative feedback.</p>

The users have expressed positive opinions and experiences with my prototype. They have reported that it helped them reduce stress, anxiety, depression, pain, and insomnia; enhance mood, memory, attention, and creativity; and promote relaxation, healing, and well-being. They have also reported that they liked the features and functions of my prototype. </p>","<p>My solution currently serves about 100 people, who have participated in the testing and evaluating my prototype. These people are from different backgrounds and contexts, such as students, HR professionals, parents, and survivors of trauma. They have different types and levels of mental health issues, such as stress, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal ideation. They have different needs and goals for using my solution, such as relaxation, meditation, mood enhancement, pain relief, or sleep improvement.</p>
<p>I have recruited these people through various channels and methods, such as online platforms, social media, flyers, word-of-mouth, referrals, and partnerships with local clubs in college. I have obtained their informed consent and ensured their confidentiality and privacy. I have provided them with a smartphone app and a wearable device that deliver sound-vibration interventions based on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-therapy techniques. I have also provided them with instructions and guidance on how to use the solution and what to expect from it.</p>
<p>I have engaged with these people for a period of four weeks, during which they have used my solution at least three times a week for 20 minutes each time.

Sound and vibration are powerful tools that can influence our mood, emotions, cognition, and physiology. They can help us relax, meditate, cope with pain, sleep better, and enhance our well-being.</p>
<p>Our solution also leverages <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>self-therapy</strong> techniques to personalize and optimize the interventions for each user. AI can analyze the user’s data and feedback to generate the most effective sound vibration patterns for their needs and goals. Self-therapy can empower the user to take charge of their own healing process and learn skills to cope with their challenges.</p>
<p>Our solution could catalyze broader positive impacts from others in this space by providing a novel and accessible way of delivering mental health care. It could inspire more research and innovation on the effects of sound vibration therapy on different mental health conditions and populations. It could also change the market by creating a new niche of wearable devices and apps that offer sound-vibration therapy as a service.</p>
<p>Our solution approaches the problem of mental health in a new or significantly improved way by offering a non-invasive, non-pharmacological, and user-friendly alternative to conventional treatments. It could complement or supplement other forms of therapy and medication, depending on the user’s preferences and needs. It could also reach more people who may not have access to or trust in traditional mental health services.</p>
<p>Additionally, our solution is innovative because it uses <strong>sound and vibration</strong> in a synergistic way to create a unique sensory experience that engages both the auditory and tactile systems. Sound and vibration can interact with each other to produce different effects on the brain and body. For example, sound can modulate the perception of vibration and vice versa. Sound and vibration can also stimulate different brain regions and neural pathways that are involved in emotion regulation, memory formation, pain modulation, and stress response. By using sound and vibration together, our solution can enhance therapeutic outcomes and user satisfaction.</p>","<p>Our impact goals for the next year and the next five years are:</p>

<p>Sickle cell disease is particularly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, where it affects up to 4% of the population. It is also common in countries in the Middle East, India, and the Caribbean. </p>
<p>In the United States, sickle cell disease affects around 100,000 people, primarily African Americans. It is also found in Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and people of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent.</p>
<p>Overall, sickle cell disease is a global health issue that affects millions of people, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where access to treatment and care may be limited.</p>
<p>The problem we are solving is increasing the capacity and resilience in the health system, improving primary healthcare and because the Vula technology collects data it produces insights that inform future interventions and decision making by health administrators, ministries of health and funders.</p>","<p>Vula is an app and web service that connects health workers.

It is also found in people of Hispanic, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean descent.</p>
<p>Target population for the Vula solution is that served by the Navrongo Health Research Centre (NHRC). This is a research institution located in the town of Navrongo in northern Ghana. The NHRC serves a population of approximately 152,000 people living in the Kassena-Nankana District and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Navrongo is located in the Upper East Region of Ghana, which is one of the poorest regions in the country. The population in the area is largely rural, and many people rely on subsistence farming for their livelihoods.</p>
<p>The poverty rate in the Upper East Region is higher than the national average, and the region faces a number of social and economic challenges, including limited access to healthcare, education, and other basic services. These challenges have a significant impact on the health and well-being of the population, particularly on vulnerable groups such as children, women, and people with chronic health conditions like sickle cell disease.</p>
<p>Through Vula's work connecting primary health workers in the rural communities with the specialist services at the NHRC we aim to improve the health and well-being of people in the area, particularly those who are most vulnerable and marginalized. </p>

Vula operates through an app and web service, facilitating communication between primary health workers and specialists across more than 60 specialty services. The service aims to reduce unnecessary referrals, improve healthcare worker communication, and provide actionable data to health administrators.

Sickle cell disease, a genetic blood disorder, is especially prevalent in populations with African ancestry, affecting up to 4% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and also significant in other regions worldwide. The solution specifically targets the population served by NHRC in the Kassena-Nankana District, addressing challenges such as limited healthcare access and poor socioeconomic conditions. Vula's mission in this context is to enhance health outcomes for the most vulnerable and marginalized, leveraging the technology to bridge gaps between primary care and specialist services.

Vula is in the ""Scale"" stage of development, evidencing its maturity and sustainability by its deployment in several communities or countries, with a focus on operational efficiency. The service has impacted a significant number of health workers (31,314) and patients (1,099,492) to date, as of May 11, 2023, and generates monthly data analytic reports for 312 health administrators. It has also produced six research publications detailing its use and impact.

77877,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,Empowering travellers with secure access to complete health information to drive better health outcomes - a platform that facilitates access to health information on the go for when it's needed most,"<p>Currently, the lack of sharing health data across countries almost entirely prevents individuals from accessing their medical records while traveling, posing a significant challenge. The problem we are solving affects International Travellers and Medical Tourists.
International Travellers: According to the UNWTO (United Nation World Tourism Organization), more than 900 million people globally traveled in 2022. Among these travelers were frequent flyers, including those traveling for business and leisure, who may find themselves in need of their medical information in the case of accidents or medical emergencies. In the UK alone, travel insurers paid out £209 million in reimbursements for medical conditions in 2018. This number is expected to be much higher post the pandemic. Research shows that around 10-42% travellers develop illness during or after their journey.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Medical Tourists: The medical tourism market projects a worth of $35.9 billion by 2032, with 14 million people specifically traveling for medical care in 2022. Within the UK, the NHS has a waiting list of 7.2 million people, leading individuals to resort to private healthcare or seek treatment abroad. Unfortunately, their data becomes inaccessible due to locked IT systems in Primary and Secondary care. Even formal requests for access to this data in cities like London can take 2-4 weeks to process. Despite technological advancements, a significant number of Brits and Americans still carry stacks of paper records while traveling for medical, dental, and cosmetic procedures, particularly in regions such as Asia and Latin America. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In our interviews with over 100 stakeholders in the UK, doctors highlighted the difficulties they face in making accurate diagnoses due to the lack of context and authenticity of the provided information. Travelers, on the other hand, expressed frustration in accessing their medical records, which often prove useless due to translation issues and nuances in medical data entry. People are tied on time and money during travel and the current system does not help make their situation easier. Therefore, enabling patients to have control over their health by granting them quick, secure, and effortless access to their complete medical history becomes crucial.  </p>","<p>Across enables travelers to access their health records on the go and provide it to their healthcare providers. Across has three interconnected subsystems. 
a. A patient-facing app to facilitate secure access to health information.
</p>
<p>b. A secure global EHR exchange system leveraging FHIR (the global standard for health information exchange) and API keys (for user authentication). This enables the international health systems to exchange health records reliably and securely.
</p>
<p>c. A practice dashboard: This enables the GP to access the treatment history of when their patient was away. This closes the loop on care-data.

</p>","<p>Across serves the following:</p>
<p>a.     <b>International </b><b>Travellers:</b> Across serves a wide range of travellers, including frequent flyers, those with chronic illnesses, and medical tourists. By providing quick and easy access to their medical data while travelling, our solution can have a significant impact on their lives. Frequent flyers spend a considerable amount of time abroad and are at risk of needing medical care from a hospital that may not have access to their medical information. Across will ensure that their medical data is readily available to healthcare providers in case of an emergency, leading to better decision-making and quality of care. Travellers with chronic illnesses face a similar scenario. They may need to take long-term life-saving medication, which may not be available (forgotten or lost) while they are away. Our solution enables healthcare providers to access their medical data and ensure that they receive the necessary medication, reducing the need for re-diagnosis and saving time and cost. 
</p>

<p>b.      <b>Medical tourists</b> can also benefit from Across as it can streamline the process of accessing medical data and reduce the hassle of pre-requesting medical documents weeks before travelling or giving a medical history by word of mouth. 
</p>
<p>   
</p>
<p>c.      <b>Healthcare providers</b> are another crucial customer segment that is currently underserved. They often spend too much time on administrative tasks, such as accessing patient data, which can be frustrating and inefficient. In some cases, they may even need to repeat tests or procedures that have already been done elsewhere. This not only wastes time and money, but also creates unnecessary stress and uncertainty for healthcare providers, which can compromise the quality of care they provide. To improve the lives of healthcare providers, we need to reduce their administrative burdens and provide better access to patient data, so they can focus on what really matters: delivering high-quality care to their patients. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>d.     <b>Travel Insurers</b> provide coverage for patient healthcare while abroad. Their main focus is to generate profit, attract more customers, and reduce expenditure on reimbursements. Travel insurers can benefit from Across by reducing the amount spent on reimbursements for repeat tests and procedures, their policies and packages will also become more appealing thus increasing their sales. 
</p>","<p>Across emerged from Noorain's personal experience, which had a profound impact on her. Her uncle was diagnosed with COVID-19 during a business trip to the USA and had unfortunately not brought any medical records due to the short duration of his stay.  </p>
<p>Complicating matters further, he had a long history of heart disease, which posed significant challenges in his treatment. Despite his painful three-week hospitalization, the lack of past records left her uncle and the entire family feeling helpless and concerned. This experience motivated Noorain to research digital solutions for securely carrying health data across different countries. However, she was disappointed by the available options she found.  </p>
<p>In November 2020, she presented her idea at the DigiEduHack, hosted by EIT Health Spain, and it won first place. Encouraged by the positive feedback from the jury, she decided to pursue the concept actively. To gain a deeper understanding of global health systems, she worked at a HealthTech company in the US for a year. This experience provided valuable insights into the infrastructure and revealed the key pain points faced by patients and doctors. It also made her keenly aware of the existing shortcomings in the healthcare industry. Inspired by this newfound knowledge, she enrolled in the MedTech Innovation and Entrepreneurship program at King's College London to develop her idea further. </p>
<p> With the guidance of her supervisor, Prof. Prashant Jha, a Medtech Guru with over 2 decades of experience in developing impactful solutions, a diverse and talented team of individuals was assembled from Asia and Europe who shared a passion for creating impactful solutions. Our team includes members from the engineering and business schools at King's and is united by our collective experiences of witnessing inefficient care due to limited access to data while abroad. In April 2023, we officially established Across Medical.  </p>
<p>We conducted over 100 interviews across the UK to identify pain points with the aim of iterating our design to address market needs with the features of our product.  </p>
<p>We are embedded in Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS foundation trust, one of the busiest NHS trusts in England and one of the most diverse populations in the world – Lambeth. This enables us to actively collaborate with GPs, specialists, and A&amp;E staff while receiving valuable mentorship from the NHS Spine, a dedicated vertical within the NHS focused on improving healthcare provider access to information. </p>
<p> We recognize that our greatest strength lies in our diverse team and our unwavering passion for solving this unmet need. We are determined to continually learn, adapt, and unlock the true potential of Across to help diminish the barriers posed by national borders when it comes to accessing quality healthcare. With support from renowned institutions and the collective efforts of our team, we aim to make a significant impact and empower individuals to have seamless access to their health data across different countries. Together, let's build a future where healthcare knows no boundaries. </p>","Enable continuity of care, particularly around primary health, complex or chronic diseases, and mental health and well-being.","London, UK",United Kingdom,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone",<p>We have developed an initial version of the product and are currently iterating its design based on feedback we receive from key stakeholders. </p>,"<p>Our product is currently in the prototype stage, but based on the secondary data available and keeping our estimates conservative at 1% of the total available market we are estimated to serve approximately 9 million travellers each year.

We also plan securing one travel insurance partner through networking and events. Across will help travellers around the globe take journeys with confidence, save them time and costs of care, and ensure they pack just their bags not worries while planning a trip. It will also help healthcare providers worldwide access accurate medical information to help better decision making, remove language barriers associated with treating patients from foreign countries, boost administrative efficiency, and provide a hassle-free experience for all their patients.   </p>
<p>In the next 5 years we aim to enter the European, American, and Asian markets and secure collaborations with leading insurance companies and medical tourism facilities. We will also continue digital promotions and print advertisements to reach people who do not purchase travel insurance but would benefit from our service. We hope to have touched the lives of over 6 million travellers by year 5.  </p>","3. Good Health and Well-being, 10. Reduced Inequalities","<p>Across addresses two important goals outlined by the United Nations: ensuring good health and well-being (SDG 3) and reducing inequalities (SDG 10).  </p>
<p>First, let's talk about SDG 3. Across allows travelers to access their health records whenever and wherever they need them. Through our user-friendly app, people can securely retrieve their entire health history, eliminating the need to carry around stacks of physical records. This not only saves time and effort but also ensures that crucial medical information is readily available, especially during emergencies. By putting this power in the hands of individuals, we empower them to take control of their health and well-being. </p>
<p>But we don't stop there. We believe in continuity of care, regardless of borders. That's why we enable users to share their health information with their home GP. This helps ensure that their healthcare providers have access to complete and up-to-date records, even when they receive treatment in a different country. By closing the loop on care, we facilitate better coordination among healthcare providers, leading to improved healthcare outcomes for patients. </p>
<p>Now, let's move on to SDG 10, which focuses on reducing inequalities. Across plays a role in leveling the playing field when it comes to accessing healthcare services. Our platform allows travelers to conveniently and affordably access care in other countries. By securely connecting them with their health records, we remove barriers and ensure that individuals receive the care they need, regardless of where they are. </p>
<p>In addition, Across benefits both home-country hospitals and destination hospitals. For home-country hospitals, our solution provides access to information on international treatments, ensuring that healthcare providers can deliver seamless care and make informed decisions. This reduces the burden on staff who would otherwise need to process emergency data requests, allowing them to allocate their time and resources more efficiently. </p>
<p>For destination hospitals, Across provides secure access to complete patient information. This enables healthcare providers to make better clinical decisions based on a comprehensive medical history. We also tackle language barriers by translating records, ensuring effective communication between healthcare providers and patients. </p>
<p>By improving the efficiency of healthcare delivery and enhancing access to information, Across helps hospitals see more patients and potentially increase revenue. This fosters a fairer and more equal healthcare system, where everyone has an opportunity to receive quality care, regardless of their location. </p>
<p>Across's solution aligns with the United Nations goals by promoting good health and well-being through convenient access to health records, while also reducing inequalities in healthcare access and ensuring continuity of care across borders. We are passionate about making a positive impact on people's lives and believe that our solution can contribute to a healthier and more equitable world</p>","<p>Our theory of change is grounded in a logical framework that links our activities to immediate outputs and longer-term outcomes for our target population. The current problems caused by an inefficient global health information exchange systems lead to several issues. These issues along with the impact Across would have on them are listed below:</p>
<p>Loopholes in treatments abroad – Across ensures that all treatments are captured effectively and available for the home provider to access and use – this leads to informed decisions and better outcomes.</p>
<p>Repeat tests for diagnosis – Across helps reduce the number of tests patients have to undergo by providing access to complete and verified patient history – this helps patients save time and money on their trips.</p>
<p>Language barriers – Across allows providers to access translated versions of medical data to effectively diagnose patients – saves providers time and reduces administrative burden while saving costs and improving patient experience. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>By leveraging cutting-edge technology, our solution enables secure, on-the-go access to life-saving medical data, which leads to faster diagnosis and treatment and ultimately, improved health outcomes for patients. We have conducted third-party research and evaluations to support the strength of our theory of change, and we have also gathered data from interviews with our target population to inform the development and implementation of our solution. Our strong theory of change is supported by evidence that shows a positive correlation between improved access to medical data and improved health outcomes, and we are confident that our solution will have a significant impact on addressing the problem of limited access to medical data. </p>","<p>The core technology that powers Across is a combination of cloud computing, natural language processing models trained on large sets of medical data, and FHIR-based API keys for privacy and user authentication.

<p>B2C - Patients: Across offers an annual access subscription to frequent travellers at a cost of £49.99. We aim to reach this customer segment via digital presence utilising social media and digital promotion as well as print advertisements.<br /></p>
<p>B2B - Insurers: Across can be implemented into insurance policies as an add-on feature, enabling access to data for the duration of the trip. This will save them costs on reimbursements through the avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic tests and procedures. We offer access to Across as an insurance add on with a cost of 1.99 to the end-user and a volume based bulk pricing to the insurance company (£50,000 per month).
</p>
<p>B2B - Hospitals: Across helps hospitals that specialize in medical tourism provide better care, build reputation, and gain competitive advantage. They will pay a fee for the service as they are expected to increase profits by saving costs and attracting more medical tourists.
</p>
<p>B2B - NHS: Across facilitates continuity of care and up-to-date information for the NHS. They will function as data-partners to Across and not be charged for the service. 
</p>
<p>The cost of acquiring each B2C customer would be around £15 and that for B2B would be £1000. The revenue generated from each B2C customer would be £50 per year retained for 3-years on average. While the B2B client would bring in £600,000 per year on a 2-year contract. Keeping our estimates conservative (less than 1% of market size) we plan on onboarding 10000, 20000, and 30000 in year 1,2, and 3 respectively for B2C. For B2B this would be 1,2, and 4 clients in the 3 different years. Unit economics for B2C would be £11.6 and for B2B is estimated at £1200.
</p>",Organizations (B2B),"<p>Grants - we are currently applying to multiple grants for initial financial support </p>
<p>Support from university: The project is being developed in collaboration with King's College London and has support from the King's network which will help   partnerships and collaborations with key customer segments</p>
<p>Fundraising - We will soon be actively working on raising funds from investors in the UK and Europe for product development and testing.</p>
<p>Revenue generation: Through B2B and B2C routes</p>",<p>Since we are in the early stages of prototype development we currently have no real evidence to demonstrate financial sustainability. We have secured collaborations with NHS Spine for product development and have recently commenced efforts to liase with investors for raising funds. The company has so far bootstrapped to cover initial costs and has almost no capital expenses due to support from King's College London. </p>,True,Pass,,,,,,"{""criteria_1"": {""result"": ""pass"", ""reason"": ""The proposal is complete, intelligible, and appropriate.

The proposal outlines a platform named Across that facilitates secure, on-the-go access to health information for individuals needing medical assistance while abroad. The platform is designed around three main subsystems: a patient-facing app, a secure global EHR exchange system leveraging FHIR standards and API keys for user authentication, and a practice dashboard for GPs to access their patients' treatment history abroad. This system aims to benefit not only travelers but also home-country hospitals, visiting-country hospitals, and travel insurers by streamlining the process of medical data exchange, improving clinical decision-making, and reducing the burden of repeat procedures and tests.

Across aims to serve a wide range of stakeholders, including international travelers—specifically those with chronic illnesses and medical tourists—healthcare providers, and travel insurers. The solution proposes to impact these groups by providing seamless access to medical records, reducing administrative burdens on healthcare providers, and potentially lowering costs for travel insurers through decreased reimbursements for repeat tests and procedures.

The team behind Across is led by Noorain, motivated by a personal experience related to the challenge at hand. The team, which includes professionals with a background in healthcare and technology, is currently based in London, UK, and has reached the prototype development stage of their product. This stage is evidenced by the creation of an initial version of the product and the undertaking of user feedback for further iterations. Although the product has not yet served users, based on market estimates, the team anticipates serving approximately 9 million travelers annually at a 1% capture rate of the total market.

Their application to Solve is driven by the need for resources to further develop the product and expand its reach. They seek support in areas such as business model development, financial planning, legal matters, product distribution, public relations, and technology advancement.

The solution, while innovative, is based on existing technologies like cloud computing, natural language processing, and FHIR standards for health information exchange. The team has outlined a business model that includes both B2C and B2B revenue streams, targeting travelers, insurance companies, hospitals, and healthcare systems like the NHS.

In terms of diversity, equity, and inclusivity, the team showcases a commitment to maintaining a diverse team composition that reflects the global focus of their solution. Their approach to impact measurement aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), focusing on the accessibility of health records, the continuity of care across borders, and the reduction of healthcare inequalities.

Lastly, the solution outlines a financial sustainability plan that includes seeking grants, leveraging university support, engaging in fundraising efforts, and generating revenue through its proposed business model. However, as the solution is in the early stages of development, there are no concrete examples of financial sustainability so far."

And 75% of population still have negative stigma, and even have non-empathetical approach over people with mental problem. A 5,211 respondent research from Change.org and Into the Light also found that 98% of its respondent felt lonely in the past month, with 73% never access professional mental service, as 66% claimed to do self-help method.</p>
<p>The situation gets worsen as Indonesia has one of the biggest social media users in the world: Top 3 facebook user, top 4 instagram user, top 2 tiktok user, and top 5 most-active twitter user. Contradicting its slow but expensive internet, Indonesian seems to be very keen to consume and create content online. With social media penetration at over 88% from its 270 million population (24% of its population is young people between the age of 10-24), this puts a large amount of the population at an increased risk of feeling anxious, depressed, or ill over their social media use, as research suggest the bad side effect of social media. The Microsoft's Digital Civility Index stated that Indonesian netizen is the most impolite and uncivilized in South East Asia, and instead of proving that wrong the Indonesian netizen mobbed the post until its comment disabled. That's the result of a toxic internet culture.</p>
<p>Non-sufficient professional mental services, overuse of social media, and the low Indonesian education rate (only 11% Indonesian have finished university) will create a problem for the majority that can't find quality material for the mind online which mostly provided in English language. As we want to tackle the social media-driven mental health issue.</p>","<p>Greatmind produces quality content about the concept of psychology and mental well-being. At first we produces content to lower the stigma of mental problem, but as we get respond from our audiences and see that the need for a more practical content rises with the lack of professional services, we shifted to produces a more practical take on mental hacking that serves as some kind of 'over the counter' mental well-being material. With the principle of slow media journalism and non-news content, Greatmind beg to differ from its anxiety-inducing surrounding media. By providing free-to-consume mental health material, audiences can take the first step towards becoming a better individual IRL and URL. The audiences need this solution as well, as shown by the exponential growth of Greatmind's social media followers (300+K follower on instagram) and content subscribers (300K+ Youtube subscriber), with vibrant engagement. Greatmind levels its intervention through several deepness:</p>
<p>1st: bitesize, micro blogging via social media,</p>

<p>3rd: unplugged, books and printed publication, community event and after hours session, mental health conference and festival, merchandise, directory of mental health service partners, survey and research,</p>
<p>4th: engagement, mentoring, retreat, support group, counseling, professional mental health services and facility.</p>
<p>Aiming to make the mind health so that critical and creative thinking could flourished in digitally literate society.</p>","<p>In the initial stage we produced social media content to get traction and get the correct profile of audience that we want to impact, since we want to tackle the social media-driven mental health issue. From the initial page, 87% of our social media audiences are 18-34 years old, half of them is young people who might not have the capacity to get mental health support. And as many young people in Indonesia still living with their extended family in a tight close setting, many of the older generation might not allowed their youngster to get mental health support, afraid of the stigma. Most of our audience experience a contemporary mental phase, described as the quarter life crisis, a period of self-discovery and self-confusion as they finally reach adulthood. As they enters the workforce as early to mid level worker, their struggle to prove themselves and to outperform in competitive work environment nowadays while navigating work from home amongst other various other crises, and societal pressure worsen by social media they might feel overwhelmed and might led to burn out, or even stress and depression. We gather this insight via social media and community sessions. If you see through our comments and feedbacks from our audiences, you will see that the content actually helping exactly the people without privilege, young people without the financial capacity and/or access to professional mental health services, young people being pressured by negative stigma so bad they don't have the courage to go seek helps, people without the privilege of speaking English-as most of the quality mental health content mostly in, these people find our content help to understand their condition even soothes themselves, as the first step toward the process of healing mentally.</p>","<p>I have a background study in graphic design and psychology, and for most of my life working in media. My interest in psychology study rises from my own mental problem, as I experienced low self-esteem and the complicated way of thinking of creative worker as graphic designer, some of it stemmed from childhood trauma of distance upbringing and the lack understanding of mental sensation some might feel. I grew up away from my parents in a village 600 km from the capital. And as a Christian Chinese descent in Indonesia, I'm a double minority, thus being discriminated was my reality. Even at only 12 years old I bear witness to the 1998 riot which targeted Chinese descent to blame for the economic crisis that happened. The trauma still linger to this day, as we never really get the chance to accept the recognition of the riot for us to heal. The decision to start the solution via media is to make it easier for us to reach the community. As trauma is complicated, and as I know the problem is quite deep in Indonesia, I lead Greatmind to be as open as possible, we're working with many of likeminded platforms, from other well-being-focused media and content company to psychology dispatch tech company, creating event and content collaboration. We help the effort to raise funds to build mental health facilities, we amplify the voices of those discriminated because of their trauma, host events to disseminate research related to mental health, and we do several outreach program to religious and spiritual organization also non-mental health media/content company and influencers to bring awareness to the issue even more.</p>","Improve accessibility and quality of health services for underserved groups in fragile contexts around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, LGBTQ+ individuals, etc.)","Jakarta, Indonesia",Indonesia,"Growth: An organization with an established product, service, or business model that is rolled out in one or more communities",,"<p>An average total of 1 Mio visited the web, 600K+ followed Greatmind various social media, 348K+ subscribe to youtube channel and 5K in our community newsletters.</p>","<p>Personally I'm coming from a conventional business background, I want to learn how to grow Greatmind to become a true tech startup, by using the solver network to gain knowledge and valuable mentoring.

Indonesia, with a population of over 200 million, has only about 1,000 mental health professionals, leading to a significant gap in mental health support. Greatmind seeks to fill this gap by offering quality, accessible content on psychology and mental well-being in the Indonesian language, catering primarily to the digitally active segment of the population that is most at risk.

Greatmind is positioned at the 'Growth' stage, as the organization has an established product and business model that has been rolled out in communities. This claim is supported by the platform's significant social media presence, with more than 300,000 followers on Instagram and a similar number of subscribers on YouTube, demonstrating vibrant audience engagement and a growing community receptive to their materials. 

The solution serves primarily young Indonesians aged 18-34, a demographic that faces unique pressures and barriers, such as living in tight-knit extended families where mental health issues may be stigmatized, and the challenge of accessing professional mental health support due to either financial constraints or language barriers. Greatmind's content aims to provide a first step toward mental well-being, especially for those who cannot afford or access professional help. This aligns with addressing UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and 4 (Quality Education) by increasing access to mental health materials and enhancing digital literacy.

The founder’s background in graphic design and psychology, combined with personal experiences of mental health issues and discrimination, positions the team uniquely to address the challenges faced by Indonesians regarding mental health stigma and access. Greatmind's approach includes broad collaboration with like-minded organizations and platforms, expanding their reach and impact.

Financially, Greatmind has demonstrated sustainability through sponsorships and content sales to businesses, indicating a viable business model. Future plans include developing a subscription service for users, supplemented by grant funding for those unable to afford services, and partnership with governmental and private sector entities to further disseminate their work.

Greatmind's solution is innovative in its approach to mental health education and support, leveraging media and content to reach a wide audience in a context where direct access to professional services is limited. The organization measures its impact through various indicators, such as access to mental health material, reduction in stigma, and increased digital literacy, with the ultimate goal of contributing to a decrease in the suicide rate and improving overall mental well-being in Indonesia."
